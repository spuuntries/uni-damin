    "desc": "Kronii and Kaela wants to decide on a tag that they will be using in the future collab. After the first poll, Kronii decides the tag to be \"Kroela\", but Kronii saw someone suggests \"Timesmith\". Apparently the comment section got divided to a perfect 50/50 on deciding whether it should be \"Timesmith\" or \"Kroela\". Kronii asked Kaela to decide, but she doesn't want to. So, they decide using a spinning wheel. \"Timesmith\" will be the next tag.\n\nNote From Osekkai\u304a\u305b\u3063\u304b\u3044:\nI dunno whose comment she read about Timesmith, but I do hope that she read mine.

When I think of honorable, I think of someone putting their body/life on the line for someone else. Since superhero's tend to be pretty honorable by nature, this list is almost completely composed of superhero movies, which I'm sure yall wont mind. And I would have definitely added Iron mans sacrifice from Endgame if Marvel didn't like to block my videos so often. Also sorry for the mediocre quality of the Forest Gump clip, that was the best I could find. I hope you guys like my picks this time around!\n\nLove you guys, stay safe and be good people.",

White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family's financial security, White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to power in the world. The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man to a kingpin of the drug trade.\n\n#BreakingBad #BryanCranston #CrimeCity #WalterWhite #AaronPaul #JessePinkman",

From the seemingly harmless King Candy to the shocking reveal of his true identity as Turbo, we\u2019ll break down the subtle clues and brilliant storytelling that made this twist so impactful. We\u2019ll analyze how Disney subverted expectations, turning a fun and colorful world into a dark tale of obsession and betrayal. Through clever foreshadowing, character development, and a seamless blend of humor and suspense, Wreck-It Ralph delivers one of Disney\u2019s most memorable and surprising villains. Join us as we unpack the genius behind this twist and why it stands out in Disney\u2019s animated legacy.",

I did put the 2 parts in the end which showing Kronii is actually beinbg kind to Mumei, so that people wouldn't misunderstand the situation.\n\nSource : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0[MINECRAFT]\u00a0minecraft\u00a0chu\u00a0\u00a0\nMumei Ch : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@nanashimumei\u00a0\u00a0\nKronii Ch : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@ourokronii\u00a0\u00a0\nGura Ch : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@gawrgura\u00a0\u00a0\nBaelz Ch : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@hakosbaelz\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOutro BGM : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a01\u00a0Hour\u00a0of\u00a0Shirakami\u00a0Fubuki\u00a0Ending\u00a0BGM...\u00a0\u00a0\nOutro Angry Sui : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Sui-chan\u00a0Wants\u00a0To\u00a0Hang\u00a0Out!\u00a0\u00a0\nOutro Walking Sui : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Suisei\u00a0Visits\u00a0Her\u00a0Hoshiomi\u3010Hololive\u00a0|...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you wish to contact me, send me an email!

    "desc": "Info:\n\n\ud83c\udfa7     Gibran Alcocer   Idea 10 Piano Mix    1 Hour Loop  \n \nIt was a cool evening, with autumn's golden leaves falling gently to the ground. The sunset painted the sky in shades of crimson and orange as the city slowly cloaked itself in darkness. In a small restaurant by the window, flickering candlelight danced on the tables, while the walls were adorned with paintings from a bygone era. This place, where two people would share the most intimate moment of their lives, held a warm atmosphere filled with the echoes of the past.\n\nDefne and Emre had visited this restaurant many times over the years. Every table held memories\u2014happy days, moments of joy, even small arguments... But tonight was different. Tonight was their last dinner together.\n\nWhen Emre sat across from Defne, his eyes filled with unshed tears. His heart was not ready to accept this farewell. But life sometimes requires making the hardest decisions. There was sadness in Defne's eyes, but there was also a calmness, a dignity in how she faced this farewell. The soft music of the restaurant filled the room, as if trying to ease their pain.\n\nIn the center of the table stood a delicate vase of white roses. Emre had chosen these roses specifically. White symbolized purity and innocence\u2014the purest and most innocent form of their love. But it also took on a meaning as a symbol of their parting.\n\nThe first course was served, and they both tried to savor the food. But each bite felt like a drop of sorrow falling into their hearts. Defne reached out and gently squeezed Emre's hand. \"I will remember this moment forever,\" she said. Her voice trembled slightly, but the determination in her eyes showed that she had come to terms with this farewell.\n\nEmre did everything he could not to hurt her. \"You know,\" Emre began, never breaking eye contact with Defne, \"I fell in love with you here for the first time. That day, sitting in this restaurant with you, I imagined spending a lifetime together.\" Defne's eyes filled with tears, but she did not cry. Because tonight was not a time for mourning, but a celebration of the deep love they had for each other.\n\nThroughout the meal, they shared beautiful memories from the past. The day they first met, the vacations they took together, the sweet words they exchanged... Each memory made their love more meaningful, and saying goodbye even harder.\n\nWhen dessert arrived, Emre pulled out a small box from his pocket. Inside was a delicate gold bracelet, inscribed with the words, \"Always in my heart.\" Defne could no longer hold back her tears as she accepted this final gift. As Emre fastened the bracelet around her wrist, he whispered, \"This is our eternity. Though we may be apart in body, our souls will always be together.\"\n\nThen came the moment they had both been avoiding all night. The moment of parting. As they walked towards the door of the restaurant, it felt as though time had stopped. Outside, a cold wind was blowing, but inside, they felt the warmth of the love they had for each other. Emre took Defne in his arms one last time and placed a gentle kiss on her hair. \"I will always love you,\" he whispered. Defne rested her head on his chest and took a deep breath. \"I know,\" was all she said. Because sometimes words fail to capture the depth of the heart.\n\nAs Emre let go of Defne for the last time, a single tear rolled down his cheek. But it was not a tear of sorrow, but of gratitude; gratitude for the years they spent together, for the memories they shared, and most importantly, for the pure love they had for each other.\n\nAs the night wore on, Defne walked away. Emre watched her go for the last time, and then left with an emptiness in his heart. But he knew that this emptiness would never fully be filled. Because some loves are not completed by time, but only in eternity.\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Wear headphones for the optimal experience!\n\nTags:\n  #LastDinner #RomanticFarewell #SorrowfulLove #HeartbreakingLoveStory #EmotionalGoodbye #RomanticEvening #LoveAndLoss #DeepConnection #TimelessLove #BittersweetMemories #HeartfeltStory #LoveEternal #FarewellDinner #RomanticStory #GoodbyeLove\n \nANIMATIONS:\n\nVideo animated by team: ByN\n   Epic Music Galaxy Family\n\n\nI am not creator/owner of audio and wallpaper you see in this video!\nIf you want to use music that is promoted in this video, then please contact with music owner(s)!\nIf you are owner of this music/wallpaper and you want this video to be removed from youtube, then please contact with our channel through facebook or gmail and we will remove video immediately after receiving your request.\nLicense to use this music and artwork (wallpaper) in this video was given directly from owner(s)/artist(s).",

From his iconic performance as the green goblin in Spider-Man and playing in American Psycho to The Lighthouse, Finding Nemo, and numerous Wes Anderson films, the range of this man\u2019s filmography is something every actor dreams of. Dafoe is loved by viewers young and old, dominating Letterboxd as the most-watched actor in 2021 and 2022. But despite being in the industry for nearly 50 years, he has yet to win a single Oscar.

They consisted of rap songs, swear words, spiel, extreme challenges, ukulele performances  and a shocking humor show titled The Filthy Frank Show, with most of the main characters played by Miller, including the main character Filthy Frank.To complement his TVFilthyFrank channel, Miller produced comedy hip hop music under his alias Pink Guy, who is also a recurring zentai-wearing character on The Filthy Frank Show, with his songs featured on the show and his discography spanning two full-length projects and an extended play. Miller's videos had a widespread impact, including starting a viral fashion dance known as the Harlem Shake, which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's Harlem Shake song atop the Billboard Hot 100.Many YouTube personalities have made major appearances or cameo appearances on The Filthy Frank Show, including h3h3Productions, iDubbbz, JonTron, Michael Stevens, and PewDiePie ..\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.Ew: 00:00:00\n2.Modus: 00:03:27\n3.Tick Tock: 00:06:54\u200b\n4.Daylight: 00:09:07\n5.Upgrade: 00:11:51\n6.Gimmie Love: 00:13:21\n7.Run: 00:16:55\n8.Sanctuary: 00:20:10\n9.High Hopes: 00:20:10\n10.Nitrous: 00:26:13\u200b\n11.Pretty Boy: 00:28:25\u200b \n12.Normal People: 00:31:01\u200b\n13.

She is saved by a mysterious rogue named Mugen and a young r\u014dnin named Jin. Mugen attacks Jin after he proves to be a worthy opponent. The pair begin fighting one another and inadvertently cause the death of Shibui Tomonoshina, the magistrate's son. For this crime, they are to be executed. With help from Fuu, they are able to escape execution.

    "desc": "Hey ya'll! Today, we lag a Pay-to-win Minecraft server using 5000 Minecarts! This server sells crate keys, 200 dollar ranks, and has over 2000 players, making Pay-to-win on it especially damaging, as it ruins gameplay and makes the game totally unfair to play on!\n\nThis was recorded more than a year ago at this point, but due to data loss, I lost all the video and the motivation to upload anything. It's why I slowed down so much. But apparently, an old external drive that I gave to relatives was never even used by them and just sat in a closet, so I got it back, used data recovery software, and voila, we're back.\n\nI chose to upload it now because it's basically just as P2W as when I first joined it, it only has removed unbans litterally nothing else that stands out. Their staff tell people that the video is from 2020 (December btw) and say that it's outdated, even though it's only the footage that is that old. The webstore is from when this video was edited, and the server is still 90% as P2W as when I originally filmed it.\n\n#AntiP2W #Minecraft\n\n[IMPORTANT] Here is a document defining what the general community thinks is P2W, and also explains how you can in 27 community translated languages:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R...\nPART 2: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0CRASHING\u00a0A\u00a0Pay-to-Win\u00a0Minecraft\u00a0Serve...\u00a0\u00a0\nCheck out Timeam!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmGm...\nFollow me on Twitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0thehorizon2b2t\u00a0\u00a0\nJoin our subreddit: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0antip2w\u00a0\u00a0\nFollow me on twitch for epico stream: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0thehorizonmc\u00a0\u00a0\nJoin our discord server!

You\u2019ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.\nI programmed my own 3D game engine from scratch. \nHow does a 3D graphics engine work? What is the graphics pipeline? I built a custom 3D graphics engine from nothing using DirectX 11 that is capable of rendering any arbitrary 3D model taken from an OBJ file. I also write several shaders, programs used to turn vertex data into something that can be seen, to give textures and shadows to the rendered triangles in the models. A work around to not being able to render objects in 2D was created. The creted 3D engine is used to create my own 3D shooter. \n\nPlay Typing Simulator 3D: https://inkbox-software.itch.io/typin...\nJoin the Inkbox Athenaeum Discord: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0discord\u00a0\u00a0\nTyping Simulator 3D official trailer:\n\nSources:\nRastertek tutorials: https://www.rastertek.com/tutindex.html\nWorld Karate Championship: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Playing\u00a0Every\u00a0Apple\u00a0II\u00a0Floppy,\u00a0E135\u00a0|...\u00a0\u00a0\nCreating a cube in unreal engine: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How\u00a0To\u00a0Make\u00a0a\u00a0Textured\u00a0Spinning\u00a0Cube\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3D Models Sources: \nJapanese teapot: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/japan...\nKeyboard: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/keybo...\nCheese wedge: (https://skfb.ly/6TFqB) by CzernO is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b....\nLow Polly Sun Glasses: (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-p...) by Luke_Swag_Walker \nLow Poly Camera\nhttps://sketchfab.com/3d-models/1990s...\n\nMusic credits:\nA Crime In Progress\nby John Bartmann from Free Music Archive\nLiscense: CC BY-SA\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant",

He walks briskly into the most restricted part of the building, his mind fixated on the problem that has plagued his office for the past couple of days \u2013 the printer. This isn\u2019t just any printer: It\u2019s an automated machine hooked up to the bank's software, designed to print transaction reports instantly, automatically, and 24/7.\n\nThis printer was a big deal, and the empty tray represented a huge problem. After troubleshooting the issue for two days, the printer finally comes back online! But then, a backlog of more than expected reports started rolling out, and it was soon obvious that something wasn\u2019t right. The New York Federal reserve received instructions to drain their entire account. Panic erupted as employees rushed to stop the transaction, but it was likely too late. \u2013 Bangladesh had just lost 1 billion dollars.",

Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0mathologer\u00a0\u00a0\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nFor this Christmas video the Mathologer sets out to explain Euler's identity e to the pi i = -1, the most beautiful identity in math to our clueless friend Homer Simpson. Very challenging to get this right since Homer knows close to no math!\n\nHere are a couple of other nice videos on Euler's identity that you may want to check out:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Math\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Simpsons:\u00a0e\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0i\u00a0pi\u00a0\u00a0 (one of our Math in the Simpsons videos)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0e\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0pi\u00a0i,\u00a0a\u00a0nontraditional\u00a0take\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0   (by 3Blue1Brown)\n\nAnd for those of you who enjoy some mathematical challenges here is your homework assignment on Euler's identity:\n1. How much money does Homer have after Pi years if interest is compounded continuously?\n2. How much money does Homer have after an imaginary Pi number of years?\n3. As we've seen when you let m go to infinity the function (1+x/m)^m turns into the exponential function. In fact, it turns into the infinite series expansion of the exponential function that we used in our previous video. Can you explain why?\n4. Can you explain the e to pi i paradox that we've captured in this video on Mathologer 2: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0e\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0pi\u00a0i\u00a0=\u00a0-1\u00a0paradox\u00a0\u00a0.\n\nIf you own Mathematica you can play with this Mathematica notebook that I put together for this video\nhttp://www.qedcat.com/misc/Mathologer...\n\nThank you very much to Danil Dmitriev the official Mathologer translator for Russian for his subtitles.\n\nMerry Christmas!",

(By \"allowable\", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.\n\nDirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vall\u00e9e Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.\n\nIn many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!\n\nMy apologies for the mistake.

Things like \"=B4/B2\" should have been \"=B4/$B$2\" so I could drag the formula down. We took that out in the interest of clarity.\n- Yes, at 13:20 I say \"the divisor ceases to lose some of its strict meaning\" which is the opposite of what I meant! the sentence needs but the one negative. Either of these would work: \"the divisor loses some of its strict meaning\" OR \"the divisor ceases to have some of its strict meaning\".\n- Sorry, at 16:47 column D is wrong. These are different numbers using 880 but the values over in E use the correct 930. It's just a display issue and does not change the results (despite being a bit confusing!). Spotted by a few people including Thomas Klemm  and AverageJon.\n- People have mentioned that Theorem 2 (and the conclusion) from this 1974 paper by Balinski & Young has an Alabama-paradox-beating method. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.71.11.4602\n- Let me know if you spot anything else.\n\nFilming and editing by Alex Genn-Bash\nAnimations by William Marler http://wmad.co.uk/\nVoice work by Ben Moor and Destin Sandlin.

    "desc": "The year is 2011, and the Los Zetas cartel is one of the most powerful organizations in the modern world. Known for their brutalness, this Mexican cartel had been responsible for numerous massacres, wiping out whole villages of people. From lavish drug kingpins to even a human trafficking ring, Los Zetas is filled with highly trained individuals, many of whom were former members of Mexico\u2019s special forces.\n\nAt this point, Los Zetas owned about a third of Mexico, along with many paid-off politicians, and businessmen, they even had a web of taxi drivers, who would feed them information, so they knew exactly where everyone was. So they could keep tabs on where their enemies are located.\n\nLos Zetas used their immense power and wealth to stay in the shadows, hidden from the public view. Because of this, the Los Zetas cartel felt truly invincible. \n\nHowever, they would soon be thrust into the spotlight, when 4Chan\u2019s hacker group, Anonymous declared war. But before we get to that, our story goes back around one year prior, at the end of  2010.\n\n\nCHECK OUT PEZLE MERCH (COMING SOON):\nhttps://www.pezle.store/\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR MORE INTERESTING INTERNET CONTENT\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapters:\n\nIntroduction: (0:00)\nPART 1 - Operation Paperstorm: (0:51)\nPART 2 - Operation Cartel: (5:00)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#4chanstory #internethistory #pezle",

With 5 major version updates and 42 new advancements, I sought to answer the question: is it possible to do them all in one hour?\n\nThe theoretically optimal time for speedrunning every Minecraft 1.21 advancement is 1:00:00.05. Phantoms, which are essential to 2 advancements, only spawn after exactly 1 hour of playtime. This TAS demonstrates an all advancements run finishing in exactly 1:00:00.05, making it unbeatable.\n\nThis is a TAS, meaning I performed the run in slow motion in many segments, spliced together and sped up to form one run. However, in the AASSG category, glitches are not allowed, meaning this run does not use exploits/duping. Most RNG is altered by using mods / datapacks, but this excludes mob/vault drops as these are seed-dependant in 1.20+.\n\nSeed: -2304956500734851952\n\nSpecial thanks:\nColin_Henry for providing a list of 230 trillion fastion ship seeds for filtering.

    "desc": "Are there limits to what computers can do? How complex is too complex for computation? The question of how hard a problem is to solve lies at the heart of an important field of computer science called Computational Complexity. Computational complexity theorists want to know which problems are practically solvable using clever algorithms and which problems are truly difficult, maybe even virtually impossible, for computers to crack. This hardness is central to what\u2019s called the P versus NP problem, one of the most difficult and important questions in all of math and science. \n\nThis video covers a wide range of topics including: the history of computer science, how transistor-based electronic computers solve problems using Boolean logical operations and algorithms, what is a Turing Machine, the different classes of problems, circuit complexity, and the emerging field of meta-complexity, where researchers study the self-referential nature of complexity questions. \n\nFeaturing computer scientist Scott Aaronson (full disclosure, he is also member of the Quanta Magazine Board).

But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. \n\nWhat happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF\u2019s Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures\u200b\u200b) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens. A few standout findings so far:\n\nWater can become a hot black ice that conducts electricity: https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-...\n\nHydrogen gas can be compressed down into a shiny metal: https://www.newscientist.com/article/...\n\nSodium (a soft, silvery metal at atmospheric pressure) can turn transparent: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...\n\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://cmap.rochester.edu/\n\nWhat happens under extreme pressures deep with planets also influences their ability to foster life.

    "desc": "Curtis Bright presents \"SAT and Lattice Reduction for Integer Factorization\" at the PIMS-CORDS SFU Operations Research Seminar at Simon Fraser University on August 22, 2024.\n\nAbstract: The difficulty of factoring large integers into primes is the basis for cryptosystems such as RSA. Due to the widespread popularity of RSA, there have been many proposed attacks on the factorization problem such as side-channel attacks where some bits of the prime factors are available. When enough bits of the prime factors are known, two methods that are effective at solving the factorization problem are satisfiability (SAT) solvers and Coppersmith's method. The SAT approach reduces the factorization problem to a Boolean satisfiability problem, while Coppersmith's approach uses lattice basis reduction. Both methods have their advantages, but they also have their limitations: Coppersmith's method does not apply when the known bit positions are randomized, while SAT-based methods can take advantage of known bits in arbitrary locations, but have no knowledge of the algebraic structure exploited by Coppersmith's method. In this paper we describe a new hybrid SAT and computer algebra approach to efficiently solve random leaked-bit factorization problems. Specifically, Coppersmith's method is invoked by a SAT solver to determine whether a partial bit assignment can be extended to a complete assignment. Our hybrid implementation solves random leaked-bit factorization problems significantly faster than either a pure SAT or pure computer algebra approach.\n\nThis is joint work with Yameen Ajani.",

    "title": "Hex Automata:  \"Optical\".  Rule t25 + Seed t6.322",
    "href": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VzK33j4XrnY",
    "desc": "New candidate for the 4-state rule-set library.   \n\nColor-coding of cells:  \n     Black (0) -- the dead or empty state,  \n     Red, Yellow, or Blue (1, 2, or 3) --  three different \"alive\" states.  \n\n2-Dimensional cellular automata, hexagonal array,  \n\nThese 3 different alive states do not correspond to any simple property of the cell pattern. This is unlike commonly seen totalistic (\"sum-of-neighbors\") rule-sets.    \n\n---------------------------------------\nGeneral Procedure:\nSTEP 1).  Make a 2-dimensional grid (array) of \"cells\" which can each have a value of 0 (off/dead) or 1 (on/alive).  Conway's famous \"Game of Life\" cellular automaton uses a square grid, but here we use a hexagonal grid (chicken-wire or honeycomb).  Initialize the grid by filling it with all zeros.  This is the \"main grid\".\n\nSTEP 2).  Add a starting \"seed\" pattern to the main grid by changing some of the cell values to \"1\" (on/alive).  Sometimes specific compact seeds are used, alternatively sometimes they are a random unstructured spread of ones that II call \"primordial soup\".\n\nSTEP 3). The program then looks at every cell in the entire main grid, one-by-one.  When examining each cell, the total number of live neighbor cells is counted among its 6 immediately adjacent neighbor cells (if using \"totalistic\" rules).  The program then consults the rule-set to decide if the central cell will be alive (1, on) or dead (0, off) in the next time-step.  In order to not disturb the cell pattern that is being updating, all of these new values are accumulated on a separate \"temporary grid\".\n\nSTEP 4). After every cell is updated on the temporary grid, the main grid is re-initialized to all zeros, and then the temporary grid is copied to the main grid\n\nSTEP 5). Repeat Steps 3 & 4 for hundreds or thousands of iterations.  The result of each iteration serves as the input for the next iteration.  The grid is finite, so the live cell pattern will eventually go repeat or go extinct, although this could take thousands of time-steps.\n---------------------------------------\nNote:  this \"Hexagon-Multiverse\" (HMCA) cellular automaton is similar to Conway's famous \"Game of Life\" in the sense that both are 2-dimensional, have binary cell states, and are synchronous and deterministic.  But the Game of Life uses a square grid, while the HMCA uses a more natural (common in nature) and more symmetrical hexagonal grid.  Additionally, the HMCA achieves interesting results using a variety of rule-sets, whereas the Game of Life is limited to a single rule-set.  \n\nHexagonal Cell Array:  size begins at 16 x 16 (columns x rows), grows incrementally, reaching 136 x 136 on time-step 310, and then remains constant.  \n\nPeriodic boundary conditions:  horizontal & vertical dimensions wrap across opposite edges, giving a finite closed continuous surface equivalent to a 2-torus (the surface of a standard 3-d ring donut).  \n\nRule-set t25 full designation: \n102000031011101000001000010330102303111031000020010003000000032000020000300130223000323,  \nThis rule-set was found by a purely random search.  \n\nTime:  322 steps (display rate 5 fps).  The first & final frames are shown for 1 & 2 seconds, respectively.  \n\nLive cell population:  starts at 42, and reaches a maximum of 1116 on time-step 313, and ends with 558 on the final time-step 322.  \n\nResolution:  2578 screen pixels per cell,  \n\nProgram:  \"Hexagon-Multiverse 1.0\" (unpublished), PHP language.  \n\nPlatform:  MacBook Pro (M1),  Sonoma 14.1.1 OS,  Safari 17.1 browser.",

The Turing Award-winning computer scientist pioneered the field of distributed systems, where multiple components on different networks coordinate to achieve a common objective. (Internet searches, cloud computing and artificial intelligence all involve orchestrating legions of powerful computing machines to work together.) In the early 1980s, Lamport also created LaTeX, a document preparation system that provides sophisticated ways to typeset complex formulas and format scientific documents. In 1989, Lamport invented Paxos, a \u201cconsensus algorithm\u201d that allows multiple computers to execute complex tasks; without it, modern computing could not exist. He\u2019s also brought more attention to a handful of problems, giving them distinctive names like the bakery algorithm and the Byzantine Generals Problem. Lamport\u2019s work since the 1990s has focused on \u201cformal verification,\u201d the use of mathematical proofs to verify the correctness of software and hardware systems. Notably, he created a \u201cspecification language\u201d called TLA+ (for Temporal Logic of Actions), which employs the precise language of mathematics to prevent bugs and avoid design flaws. \n\nRead more at Quanta Magazine: https://www.quantamagazine.org/bringi...\n\n- VISIT our Website: https://www.quantamagazine.org \n- LIKE us on Facebook: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0quantanews\u00a0\u00a0\n- FOLLOW us Twitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0quantamagazine\u00a0\u00a0\n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation https://www.simonsfoundation.org/\n#computerscience #math",

It's accessible, well written and provides a comprehensive view of the BB-world. Also, Googology represents the community in their efforts/excitement well (e.g. see ref [8]). \n\nNOTES\n\n[1] When describing how Sigma(4) is computed, I say \"whittle to a small group that halt and ran to produce the max count of 1's\". It has been pointed out to me that this isn't an accurate description. It's more accurate to say we whittle down to a small group that *don't halt*. What's done is, many machines are run, some halt and some continue to run. The hard work is in proving that the machines still running will in fact run forever. Once that is proved, the busy beaver number is the max count of ones written by all machines that halted so far.\n\nREFERENCE NOTES\n\nAs mentioned, I mainly read Scott Aaronson's work for this (ref [1], [3]) and his blog: https://scottaaronson.blog/, where he posts BB related updates. Second to this was the wikipedia page (ref [6]). Also, [2] and [7] were useful for understanding how people pursue bounds and values for Sigma(n). The original paper (ref [4]) was useful to understand why Sigma(n) was invented in the first place (to provide a well defined non-computable function) and to understand the original format of the BB competition. The bounds related to Graham's sequence were found in [6] and [8].\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] S. Aaronson, \"The Busy Beaver Frontier\",  https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/...\n\n[2] A. H.

They may be inevitable OR they may simply be the outcome of a series of steps, which likely depend on our behaviour. Yet our expectation of a certain outcome often leads us to behave just as we always have which only ensures that outcome. To escape the Bayesian trap, we must be willing to experiment.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nTony Fadell, Jeff Straathof, Donal Botkin, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Saeed Alghamdi\n\nUseful references:\nThe Signal and the Noise, Nate Silver\nThe Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes\u2019 Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy, by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\n\nBayes' theorem or rule (there are many different versions of the same concept) has fascinated me for a long time due to its uses both in mathematics and statistics, and to solve real world problems.

    "desc": "On satellite imagery, we spotted a village inside a strange crater in Madagascar. We set out to learn how it got there.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRight in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there\u2019s a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris \u2014 and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there\u2019s a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. \n\nWhen we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It\u2019s a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. \n\nCheck out an extended look at the interviews in this video: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Bonus\u00a0interviews:\u00a0What\u2019s\u00a0inside\u00a0this\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:\n\nHere is some of Michel J\u00e9brak\u2019s research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publicat...\n\nHere is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi\u2019s original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publicat...\n\nWe also spoke with Stian Rice, author of Famine in the Remaking, who helped us understand more about the history of agriculture in Madagascar:  https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/01/2...\n\nCheck out Stian\u2019s book on famine and food systems: https://wvupressonline.com/node/831\n\nNorman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell\u2019s SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/\n\nCorrection: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilm\u00e9 as a professor of geology at the University of Florida. In fact, she is a national coordinator of the Madagascar Program at the World Resources Institute. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The most expensive Star Wars sets cost $850. And prices for vintage Lego sets can reach over $1,000. These high prices have caught the attention of thieves, who in some cases have stolen about $300,000 worth of Lego. So, how did we get here? How did Lego go from a children's toy to a collector's item?

It is not definitive, and experts who agree with the main thrust of this video, will disagree on specifics. I have made a sincere effort to stick to the facts where they are available. Where they are not, I have restricted myself to informed and reasonable speculation. As stated in the video, this starts at 9:55. I welcome any discussion in the comments. \n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nHow could a massive aircraft filled with 239 people simply vanish from the face of the Earth?\n\nIt might seem impossible in the modern era, but this is exactly what happened Malaysia Airlines flight 370 on March 8th, 2014.  \n\nThere are countless theories which try to explain the mysterious disappearance - everything from a remote control hijacking, to exploding fruit in the cargo bay, have been suggested.\n\nBut what if the truth is even more disturbing?\n\nWhat if somebody on board Flight 370 was responsible?\n\nThis is the chilling story of Malaysia Airlines flight 370, and it\u2019s a story that might finally help us find the missing plane.\n\n-----\n\nThis video would not have been possible without the expertise and generosity of the following people:\n\nSimon Hardy, for sharing his knowledge as a 777 Captain, and for his technique for plotting a plausible path for MH370 over the Southern Indian Ocean. If you want to read a fictionalised account of Captain Simon Hardy\u2019s own experiences in the aftermath of the disappearance, you can do so in the book \u2018The Missing Plane\u2019 by Captain Verne Pugiev: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Missing-Plan...\n\nLarry Vance, for taking the time to speak with me during my research for this video. I have not come to the same conclusion as Larry regarding the final minutes of the flight, but his book is well-argued and has been instructive nonetheless: https://www.amazon.co.uk/MH370-Myster... \n\nI will be releasing my full interview with Larry on Patreon in the coming days. \n\nThomas Joiner, for his Psychological expertise and insight into the mentality of those who commit acts such as this. Thomas has spent his career delving into the darker parts of the human psyche both as an academic researcher and a clinician, and the insights he shared in our interview were extremely helpful in my writing the script for this video. \n\nMy interview with Thomas will be on Patreon in the coming days. \n\nHans Bos, for his invaluable insight into normal and abnormal airline operations. Without him, the story presented would have been far less informed. \n\nVictor Iannello of the Independent Group, for sharing with me his considerable expertise on the matter.

Alarms blare in the cockpit, as the pilots desperately grapple with an aircraft which seems to have a mind of its own. Oxygen masks drop from the ceiling, and terrified passengers write last-minute notes to loved ones. What has caused the massive tail to explode off the aircraft, and will the pilots be able to coax their stricken plane back to the airport? This is the story of Japan Air flight 123. \n\n-----\n\nSpecial thanks to Gohan Chan for his invaluable help in piecing together this incident using real CVR and FDR data, as well has his excellent 3D modelling.

Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, both former military test pilots, became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But Starliner's propulsion system suffered a series of glitches in the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS that has so far kept the astronauts on the station for 79 days as Boeing scrambled to investigate the issues.\n\n---\n\nNASA | SpaceX | Boeing | Starliner | Astronauts | Sunita Williams | Butch Wilmore | International Space Station | Space | Rescue Mission | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#nasa #spacex #boeing #starliner #astronauts #sunitawilliams #internationalspacestation #space #rescuemission #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

    "desc": "Plants vs Zombies and its sequels have spanned over a decade of continuous development, with the cast of plants being drastically changed and altered over time to meet the demands of new games and updates. Often, analysing how plants have changed over time really puts in to perspective how much the franchise has changed in its over 15 year run. The plant we\u2019re looking at today is Blover and, man, I bet this plant wishes it had an extra leaf because it\u2019s had one of the unluckiest histories of any plant throughout the mainline tower defense games. Blover went from being one of the most broken plants in the franchise and somehow ended up being demoted from being a plant entirely. But what exactly made Blover so unlucky? Well, there\u2019s only one way to find out, so lets analyse the history of plants vs zombie\u2019s unluckiest plant.  \n\nIf you read this you've now gained 7 days of good luck. Why?

Before the event began, players selected which island they wanted to join\u2014plains, desert, snow, or jungle. Each day, all players logged on at the same time, and session lasted around 1-2 hours. For the most part, players could do whatever they want, including mining for resources, running a business, becoming a leader, or fighting in war.

Early attempts to reach it were primarily motivated by the search for a navigable route through the Arctic to Asia, known as the Northwest Passage. Later, explorers focused specifically on reaching the Pole itself. But for centuries, reaching it seemed impossible. The polar environment was extremely unforgiving. Located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, the North Pole is covered by a vast expanse of sea ice which constantly changes due to wind, ocean currents and seasonal melts. Explorers tried to reach the pole using ships, dogsleds, and even traveling by foot. The first verified, and officially recognized expedition to reach the North Pole didn\u2019t occur until 1926 (although several explorers claimed to have reached it earlier). It was first reached using the airship Norge, which flew overhead, but did not land on the surface.  \n\nIn the late 1920\u2019s, accomplished explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins became convinced that a submarine would provide the ultimate means of reaching the North Pole. A submarine could travel for extended periods beneath the ice, avoiding the extreme hazards above which had caused earlier expeditions to fail. Carrying the latest scientific equipment, the submarine\u2019s crew could conduct valuable meteorological, oceanographic, biological, magnetic, and spectrographic experiments.\n\nWilkin\u2019s submarine would be called the Nautilus. It was a retired WW1-era submarine that had been extensively modified by renowned Naval Architect Simon Lake. The Nautilus featured a heavily reinforced bow, a shock absorber and sledge runners to protect it from collision with sea ice. A diving compartment and airlock was also added to allow divers to explore the depths while the submarine remained submerged. Most importantly, the Nautilus was fitted with three ice drills, allowing the submarine to recharge batteries, refresh air and even allow the crew to exit while the submarine still remained below the ice. \n\nThe Nautilus and her crew of 20 men began their expedition to the North Pole in June of 1931. \nNone of them realized how grueling their journey would be, and almost immediately things began to go wrong.",

The songs and artwork in this album are fan-made works created by MikoWorks.\n\nHOW TO USE:\nThese covers may be downloaded and used in public/private videos, for personal use, remixed/edited, burned to personal CDs/vinyls, or added to personal playlists. Any works shared publicly containing these covers must include credit to MikoWorks at \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@miko-works\u00a0\u00a0.

DO NOT SELL THESE COVERS.\n\nSOFTWARE USED TO MAKE THESE COVERS:\nDAW- FL Studio\nVSTs- Spitfire Audio: Originals Felt Piano, Originals Firewood Piano. Spitfire LABS: Soft Piano, Synth Pads. FL Studio Plugins: 3x Osc, Flex, Sytrus, Keyboard instrument packs\n\nWHAT'S NEW:\nAll songs were remastered (noise reduced, low frequencies reduced, and audio balanced for clarity and consistency across tracks). Bass notes were added to the \"Outer Wilds \" theme. The Prisoner's theme was added to \"Travelers' Encore.\" Different VSTs were used in \"Travelers' Encore\" and \"Outer Wilds-Reprise.\"\n\nFIND MIKO AT:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@miko-works\u00a0\u00a0\nMikoworks.tumblr.com\nMikoworksmail@gmail.com\n\n~UPDATE 7/3/2024~\nFREE MIDI DOWNLOAD: https://drive.google.com/drive/folder...\n\nQ&A:\nQ: Are sheets available?\nA: Not yet. I don't know how to write sheet music, but a fan offered to transcribe the songs to sheets. More info to come!\n\nQ: Are MIDI files available?\nA: Yes! Click the Google Drive link above to access a FREE DOWNLOAD for the MIDI files! Some of the mixer effects and dynamics couldn't be exported and a couple of songs had WAV loops that can't be converted into MIDI, but everything else should be there. Let me know if you run into any issues.\n\nQ: Is this cover available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.?\nA: No. I don't plan on providing these covers on audio streaming services. As a hobbyist musician who isn't trying to profit from these covers, it isn't my goal to provide these covers on audio streaming services. If you want to listen to these songs on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., you can download the MP3s and add them to your personal libraries on your streaming platform of choice.\n\nQ: Can I post extended versions of these covers on my YouTube channel?\nA: No. I'd prefer it if you added these songs to a loopable YouTube playlist. If there's a specific song you want to add to a loopable playlist, each song is available as its own separate video on my YouTube channel.\n~ END UPDATE 7/3/2024~\n\nLots of love,\nMiko",

My Goal is creating the ultimate escapism music library on YouTube, for people that need to escape reality, even for a second. I also network with artists and labels, so that their music can be heard and supported. Every Artist name along with the track title is always in the description of every video. So, if you want to support the artists, go and support them on their respective streaming platforms as well. Furthermore, all of the tracks used in my youtube playlists are copyrighted music, so if you see ads in my videos, it's because youtube places them automatically based on copyright-owners needs, I have no control over it, so sorry about that. And lastly, thank you so much for being a part of a wonderful community. Never thought I would be able to help so many people. Let's escape this reality together, at least for a moment. I will never stop making these videos.

Being critical isn\u2019t a bad thing, people say, \u201cOh don\u2019t be so critical of yourself!\u201d.\n\nBut there are a lot of things you can control and improve, such as your visuals, audio, and most importantly your content that you\u2019re creating. Watch back your VoD and be honest with yourself, is it up to scratch. Does your mic sound good? Are you engaging? Is it easy to watch and enjoy or is there something that is off-putting?

A large influence on this series has come from content creators like Wild4games and Nutty. \n\n\ud83c\udfacWatch our most recent videos: \nhttps://bit.ly/RecentStreamVids\n\n\ud83c\udfac Playlists You Might Like:\nhttps://bit.ly/StreamGuidesPlaylist\n\n\ud83d\udcac Streaming Guides:\n\nHow To Stream On Twitch The A to Z Guide:\nhttps://bit.ly/HowToStreamOnTwitch101\n-------------------------------SOCIAL-------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: https://bit.ly/Streamtweets\n\ud83d\udcacWebsite: https://bit.ly/Streamscheme\n\ud83d\udc26Go force Eljay to use Twitter: http://bit.ly/EljaysTweets\n#twitch #growth #guide",

Keep your messages on-topic. Use the live chat to speak to me, not to other viewers.\n2. Do not constantly type in ALL CAPS or spam the same message repeatedly.\n3. If another viewer annoys you, block them. If they are breaking the rules, report them. Leave it to the mods to sort things.\n4. Don\u2019t talk about people other than myself unless I bring them up first. Likewise, do not bring me up unprompted in other people\u2019s streams (even if it would be REALLY funny. just do it on Twitter lol)\n5. Controversial topics, political topics, and explicit remarks should not be mentioned. (Just because other VTubers are okay with certain topics, doesn\u2019t mean I am.)\n6. Harassment, bullying, and the sharing of other\u2019s personal information is strictly forbidden.\n7. Backseating or writing spoilers is strictly not allowed unless I explicitly ask you to do so. If the way I do things annoys you, do it yourself.\n8. I can only understand English and a small amount of written Japanese.

The first from botan regards the future of Aqua and how they still plan on meeting, etc. The second, from Suisei, talks about the emotional and company side of things.\n\nPekora & Marine talked extensively about their feelings with Aqua. Pekora learned from management that she was going to quit, and confronted her on discord. This was months ago. But after talking about it, she recognized that Aqua put a lot of thought into this and its not her place to discuss further. The rest were them reminiscing about their time together (Marine especially, who stated she will always be her mother.)\n\nTo be honest, there was a lot more that Suisei spoke about, but said that many people take things out of context to make her seem like a company anti or something (this was because she was talking about those who may be upset with Cover. Writing a description of it here won't do justice) and asked for it not to be clipped. I feel like if I wrote what she said here it would definitely be misconstrued, so I understand that sentiment. More or less she was trying to acknowledge the feelings of those who felt upset at the company.

The result of this work are videos that really bring feelings to people and make them meet new Lo-fi artists.

    "desc": "Childish Gambino\u2019s \u201cRedbone,\u201d the second single off of his 'Awaken, My Love!' album, centers on the narrative of infidelity and paranoia. The track got a prominent placement in the opening moments of Jordan Peele\u2019s record-breaking movie Get Out, too, leading to Platinum certification. Its instrumentation is a collaboration between Donald and Swedish composer and producer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson; the two have frequently worked together since the 2010 'Culdesac' mixtape. He went to the studio not knowing what the two had in store that day.\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/the-making-of-ch...\n\nRead all the lyrics to \"Redbone\" on Genius: https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-r...\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0genius\u00a0\u00a0\nGenius on Instagram: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0genius\u00a0\u00a0\nGenius on Facebook: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0geniusdotcom\u00a0\u00a0\nhttp://genius.com",

    "desc": "Nisha Venkat | July 7, 2022\nWatching FKJ build a song is like watching him play a game of musical tetris. One second he's coaxing a rasping rhythm out of a drum set \u2014 the next, he's clambering over instruments to get to the mic before the beat kicks in.\n\nThe process might make you want to tape your eyes open. This is not Live Production 101, and FKJ (short for French Kiwi Juice, the stage name of Vincent Fenton) is not here to explain his genius. The French producer and multi-instrumentalist is perhaps best known for his assist on Masego's sultry, rollicking \"Tadow,\" but there's only remnants of that energy here. This is new jazz: a synthy spectacle that's a treat for the ears and the eyes.\n\nYou get the sense \u2013 and Fenton confirms it \u2013 that he could spend all day tinkering in his studio. There's an ease to his motions when he grabs his guitar adding wah-wah sounds to his bassline on \"IHM,\" and something very relatable about how even the cameraman struggles to keep up with his motions, sending Fenton in and out of focus.\n\nSometimes, he grimaces (with effort or with ecstasy, who knows) when he plucks a string just right. And you might be similarly moved. This has all the shivers of ASMR with all the emotive joy of a warehouse electronic f\u00eate. Maybe you'll even feel what I did when the music ended \u2014 a silence so large, so full, you'll want to tear down the screen and dance in the jungle with him.\n\nSET LIST\n\"New Life\" \n\"TUI\"\n\"Improvised Jam Sesh\"\n\"IHM\"\n\"Ylang Ylang\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nFKJ: vocals, electronics, guitar, keyboards\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Terence Ver Angsioco\nAudio: FKJ \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O'Neill \nVideo Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Michael Zamora, Maia Stern, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #FKJ #nprmusic",

This video\u2019s a bit fast-paced, so feel free to pause and read some of the notes I put throughout the video if you want more details. Otherwise, sit back and watch the fireworks as I explain everything that went into making this massive graph.\nThis video might be the most ambitious project I\u2019ve ever made. It may not look like much considering it\u2019s only 16 minutes long, but putting together all the animations and effects was a nightmare. I also ended up having to start all over at one point because I just didn\u2019t like the direction it was going. \nI even made a custom boss theme for the opening animation section. I was originally going to use Twisted Garden for it but then decided to make my own theme for it. I should have a full song ready at some point but I\u2019ll have to see where my motivation takes me for that. \nFactoring in everything I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this video took me over 100 hours to make. Hopefully videos won\u2019t take me that long to make in the future.

Sorry for my brief absence, I decided to take a break during August, as it was too hot to get anything done.  \n\nI started working on this arrangement about five years ago, but at the time, my workflow was not as refined as it is now, and I found it too difficult to record, so I scrapped it after recording a handful of tracks.\n\nNow that I sort of know what I'm doing, I decided to dust it off and re-record everything from scratch.  This was a huge pain in the butt to mix, and there are still a few things that I'm not sure about, but I eventually decided that at some point I had to just stop tweaking things and upload it.\n\nAlso, a huge thank you to my Patrons for making this video possible!  This arrangement originally ended after the Freezeezy Peak section, but I decided to spend some money on some (more) PVC pipes so I could record the Clanker's Cavern section.  Then I decided to add the Furnace Fun section to give it a more definitive ending.",

    "desc": "This is a UX & UI design review of the music notation software: MuseScore, which has become increasingly popular over the last few years. In this video I look at three things: the visual appeal of its UI design, the usability of its navigation and how it compares to Avid\u2019s Sibelius when it comes to notation finesse. Since the company was bought by Ultimate Guitar in 2018, it\u2019s beginning to look like a serious competitor, especially since it\u2019s open source and free to use. Download it now and see for yourself!\n\nThis review focuses solely on the recently released MuseScore 3, rather than MuseScore 2, which is no longer being actively developed.\n\nThis is the second part of my notation software comparison series. The next application in line for review will be either Notion, Dorico or Finale. I\u2019ll let circumstance dictate which! Sibelius get a few mentions in this video.

Since neither of these gods are particularly well known, it was extremely difficult to find sculptures of either of them, so I used images of unusual, weather beaten statues found in Vienna.

In the vacuum of space, these images could last for billions of years, outliving the earth, outliving the sun.\n\nAnd though that should maybe be comforting\u2026 I think it scares me.  \n\n0:00 Fear of Deep Space\n1:06 Gazing into the Abyss\n3:52 A Dog Named Laika\n7:24 Under a Star Called Sun \n9:54 True Emptiness \n11:28 Signaling Aliens\n13:57 Dark Forest Hypothesis\n16:22 Pale Blue Dot \n18:55 Space Madness\n20:20 The Year Without Summer\n22:22 End of the Universe\n\nMedia Shown: 2001 A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Outer Wilds, Silent Running, High Life, Under a Star Called Sun, Star Wars, Star Trek, The Expanse, The Anglerfish Project, A Trip to the Moon, From Earth to the Moon, Mars and Beyond, War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Alien, Alien: Covenant, Alien: Isolation, Deep Impact\n\n\u266b Music Used \u2013 Left Alone \u2013 Ending Theme 2 (Detention), Komorebi (Gris), Windmill (Gris), Unagi (Gris), Sevastopol Abandoned (Alien: Isolation), Alien Reveal (Alien: Isolation), The Sun Station (Outer Wilds), 14.3 Billion Years (Outer Wilds), Back and Forth (Cloud Gardens), Kinds of Flowers (Voyager\u2019s Golden Record)\n\n\u266b Additional music by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com): \nBittersweet\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\n\nSOURCES:\nGolden Record: https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-r... \nThe Sad, Sad Story of Laika: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smiths... \nEarth\u2019s Magnetosphere: https://science.nasa.gov/science-rese... \nRisks of Space Exploration: https://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov... \nRed Giant Suns: https://www.space.com/22471-red-giant... \nEnd of the Milky Way: https://www.science.org/content/artic... \n\nCopyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \u201cfair use\u201d for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.

    "desc": "Hagoromo has been described as \"the Rolls-Royce\" of chalk.\" The formerly Japanese, now Korean brand's chalk is known for its smooth consistency, vibrancy, and being nearly dust-free. But the brand almost disappeared in 2015, which sent its loyal fans into a frenzy, buying up lifetime supplies before the factory shut down.

The transition wasn't easy, but Hyeong-seok's dedication to Takayasu's original formulas and methodology kept the brand alive. But is that enough to ensure its future?

She explains the realism of black-bear attacks and behavior in \"Cocaine Bear\" (2023) and \"Backcountry\" (2014). Wynn-Grant also looks at Po the giant panda in \"Kung Fu Panda\" (2008); the polar bears in \"The Golden Compass\" (2007), with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig; and the mutant bear in \"Annihilation\" (2018), with Natalie Portman.\n\nWynn-Grant is a large-carnivore ecologist who has been studying bears for the past 13 years. She has a doctorate in Ecology and Evolution. Her previous research includes human-carnivore conflict with grizzly bears in the Northern Great Plains and black bears in the Western Great Basin. She is a research faculty member at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She is also a research fellow with the National Geographic Society and a visiting scientist at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nYou can follow Rae here: \nhttps://www.raewynngrant.com/\n\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0raewynngrant\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nWATCH MORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nLion Expert Rates 9 Big-Cat Attacks In Movies\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Lion\u00a0Expert\u00a0Rates\u00a09\u00a0Big-Cat\u00a0Attacks\u00a0I...\u00a0\u00a0\nCrocodile Wrangler Rates 12 Crocodile And Alligator Attacks In Movies And TV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Crocodile\u00a0Wrangler\u00a0Rates\u00a012\u00a0Alligator...\u00a0\u00a0\nShark Expert Rates 10 Shark Attacks In Movies And TV \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Shark\u00a0Expert\u00a0Rates\u00a010\u00a0Shark\u00a0Attacks\u00a0I...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Bears #HowRealIsIt #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.
