From his iconic performance as the green goblin in Spider-Man and playing in American Psycho to The Lighthouse, Finding Nemo, and numerous Wes Anderson films, the range of this man\u2019s filmography is something every actor dreams of. Dafoe is loved by viewers young and old, dominating Letterboxd as the most-watched actor in 2021 and 2022. But despite being in the industry for nearly 50 years, he has yet to win a single Oscar. Therefore, I feel like it\u2019s about time to shine some light on this man's legendary career, have a closer look at his unique performances, and see why Willem Dafoe is an actor you simply cannot replace.\n\nFollow me on instagram: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0eloiducinema\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- Business Inquiries: ducinemaofficial@gmail.com\n\nThe rights for all the songs in this video are purchased through Artlist: https://artlist.io/referral/3497535/D...\n\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \u201cfair use\u201d for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.

Brought to you by Raycon.\n\n\nIn this video, we dive deep into the evolution of Batman as a character across various films, exploring how each adaptation amplifies the mythos of the Dark Knight, making him increasingly complex and captivating. The analysis covers the use of cinematic language, artistic direction, and faithful comic book adaptation, which together have shaped Batman into an enduring icon.\n\nWe start with Tim Burton\u2019s gothic interpretation in the 1989 film, where Michael Keaton\u2019s portrayal set a new standard for the character, blending darkness and heroism. The video then transitions to Christopher Nolan\u2019s critically acclaimed trilogy, focusing on Christian Bale\u2019s nuanced performance and how Nolan's direction grounded Batman in a more realistic, gritty world. Special attention is given to the cinematic techniques and themes that make these films resonate deeply with audiences.\n\nThe discussion also highlights Ben Affleck\u2019s portrayal in the DC Extended Universe, examining how his version of Batman, under the direction of Zack Snyder, reflects a more battle-worn and morally conflicted hero. Finally, the video looks at Robert Pattinson\u2019s recent take on the character in Matt Reeves\u2019 \"The Batman,\" showcasing a younger, more detective-oriented Batman, with a focus on the film\u2019s noir aesthetic and psychological depth.\n\nThroughout the video, key directors like Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder, and Matt Reeves are mentioned, alongside the actors who have brought Batman to life, analyzing how each has contributed to the legend of the Caped Crusader.\n\n\n#thebatman #thedarkknight #joker #batman #zacksnyder #nolan #penguin #thepenguin #mattreeves",

    "desc": "Bobby Carter | January 23, 2017 \u2014 BADBADNOTGOOD made a name for itself by reworking songs from the likes of Nas and Ol' Dirty Bastard, eventually catching the attention of Odd Future leader Tyler, the Creator. The masses took notice in 2015 when the group produced an entire LP for Ghostface Killah, Sour Soul. BADBADNOTGOOD has been called a hip-hop ensemble, but its foundation is clearly jazz, which provides a gateway to countless genres. On IV, the group allows that gateway to widen, adding soul and funk to the repertoire.\n\nStill only in their 20s, the band's members never seemed intimidated by the intimate nature of the Tiny Desk; if anything, it accentuated their enthusiasm. This was their zone. They played three selections from IV \u2014 including \"Cashmere,\" which only slightly veered from the studio version, and \"In Your Eyes,\" which features Charlotte Day Wilson's vocals. The tight arrangement allowed Wilson to hover gently above the instrumentation, showing off the band's most promising work to date. It was a pleasure to have BADBADNOTGOOD at the desk for IV \u2014 and exciting to imagine what's in store for V, VI and beyond.\n\nIV is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/iv/...\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/IV-2-LP-Incude...\n\nSET LIST\n\"And That, Too.\"\n\"In Your Eyes\" (Feat.

He walks briskly into the most restricted part of the building, his mind fixated on the problem that has plagued his office for the past couple of days \u2013 the printer. This isn\u2019t just any printer: It\u2019s an automated machine hooked up to the bank's software, designed to print transaction reports instantly, automatically, and 24/7.\n\nThis printer was a big deal, and the empty tray represented a huge problem. After troubleshooting the issue for two days, the printer finally comes back online! But then, a backlog of more than expected reports started rolling out, and it was soon obvious that something wasn\u2019t right. The New York Federal reserve received instructions to drain their entire account. Panic erupted as employees rushed to stop the transaction, but it was likely too late. \u2013 Bangladesh had just lost 1 billion dollars.",

It was profoundly human, compositionally creative and carried themes that are just as -- if not more potent today -- as they were 20 years ago. OK Computer marked the end of an era, setting a new path for rock music. Without it, Muse, Coldplay or Arcade Fire wouldn\u2019t exist as they do now. \n\nIn Radiohead\u2019s attempt to subvert mainstream trends and conventions, they ironically became more successful for it.

It was riddled with technical problems -- a complete nightmare for Thom Yorke who was already burnt out on playing the album\u2019s material. But it was a tour that wouldn\u2019t end for another year and a half.\n\nThe mindless cycle of creating albums then touring them was destroying Radiohead. When they had finally gotten to a place where they could take a break and not be forgotten, Thom was left catatonic. Experiencing intense depression, the success and subsequent tour of OK Computer put his mental state in a place he never wanted to be. OK Computer had become an instant classic, but now expectations for a worthy follow up were high, as critics and audiences looked at Radiohead to carry the genre forward.\n\nIn their pursuit, Radiohead suffered bouts of writer\u2019s block, leading to self-doubt and the near break-up of the band. Had they released another album in the same vein as OK Computer or The Bends, they might have become the biggest band in the world. Instead, they released Kid A in quite possibly the greatest left turn in music history.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer:\nI do not own any of the videos, photos or music used in this video.

    "desc": "Only a handful of bands truly command attention and analysis when one of their songs enters a scene. Radiohead is undoubtedly one of these bands. Sure, two of their key members are successful film composers and their unique sound definitely lends itself to cinema, but it\u2019s more than that.\n\nRadiohead\u2019s music is hard to define. It weaves in and out of various genres; it\u2019s distant yet comforting; it\u2019s harsh yet beautiful and poetic. But maybe most importantly, Radiohead\u2019s music makes us think. Listen to any random track and you can immediately tell that an extraordinary amount of thought went into every single note and word. When one of these songs accompanies a scene, this thoughtfulness bleeds into the narrative. In short, Radiohead\u2019s songs are the keys to opening doors that filmmakers didn\u2019t think they could open.\n\nIf you\u2019re as fascinated as we are about how a great composer can elevate a film, don\u2019t miss our \u201cScore Auteur\u201d series, featuring Radiohead\u2019s own Jonny Greenwood, Hans Zimmer, and Trent Reznor.

And my Indie 2D Speedrun Platformer Game has never been better! \n\nAs we go through this story together, I'll analyse my own art through the lenses of Games like Undertale, Celeste, Ghostrunner, Ultrakill, Hollow Knight, and many more. \n\nIt's also a video about the importance of Speedrunning. Strata is similar to games like Neon White in that it's designed around speedrunning (as opposed to classic speed games like the early Legend of Zelda games, where speedrunning was a happy accident).\nI make heavy reference to the wider speedrun scene, like Trackmania, Sonic the Hedgehog, Games Done Quick and all sorts.\n\nI want to start out by thanking fellow Indie Game Developer/ Gamedev YouTuber  @JuniperDev  for the initial inspiration for this Devlog Video Essay thing. \n\nIt was a fantastic video, and its virality is very much deserved. It spoke to me specifically because the entirety of Strata is built on some incredibly janky code. So, this video is about me accepting my limitations as a developer, and how doing so lead to a really unique take on the platformer genre.\n\nAlso, the \u202a@GMTK\u202c Game Jam is happening right now!!! If it weren't for the fact I just spent like three weeks working tirelessly to prepare the game for this video and need a break, I would very much be jumping in. They've made it a four-day game jam this time, which I think is a fantastic decision that makes what was already the most accessible jam even more so. \nThanks for inspiring so many people. It wasn't so long ago that I was the absolute novice stumbling upon your videos for the first time. Same goes for you, \u202a@Brackeys\u202c. \n\n\nGames you should check out cause I like the people who made them:\n\nButton Pop: \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/22...\n\nThe Mighty Claw: https://store.steampowered.com/app/23...\nDemo: https://manic-nova-games.itch.io/the-...\n\nIf I forgot to credit anyone on anything let me know and I'll update the record.\n\n\nMusic Featured:\n\nMambo For Tajrid\nCeleste OST - Mirror Temple B-Side Remix\nSonic 2006 OST -The Theme of Sonic The Hedgehog (2006)\nHollow Knight OST - The White Lady\nMinecraft - Pigstep (Jazz Cover by \u202a@insaneintherainmusic\u202c feat. \u202a@LenaRaine\u202c)",

    "desc": "The year is 2011, and the Los Zetas cartel is one of the most powerful organizations in the modern world. Known for their brutalness, this Mexican cartel had been responsible for numerous massacres, wiping out whole villages of people. From lavish drug kingpins to even a human trafficking ring, Los Zetas is filled with highly trained individuals, many of whom were former members of Mexico\u2019s special forces.\n\nAt this point, Los Zetas owned about a third of Mexico, along with many paid-off politicians, and businessmen, they even had a web of taxi drivers, who would feed them information, so they knew exactly where everyone was. So they could keep tabs on where their enemies are located.\n\nLos Zetas used their immense power and wealth to stay in the shadows, hidden from the public view. Because of this, the Los Zetas cartel felt truly invincible. \n\nHowever, they would soon be thrust into the spotlight, when 4Chan\u2019s hacker group, Anonymous declared war. But before we get to that, our story goes back around one year prior, at the end of  2010.\n\n\nCHECK OUT PEZLE MERCH (COMING SOON):\nhttps://www.pezle.store/\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR MORE INTERESTING INTERNET CONTENT\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapters:\n\nIntroduction: (0:00)\nPART 1 - Operation Paperstorm: (0:51)\nPART 2 - Operation Cartel: (5:00)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#4chanstory #internethistory #pezle",

    "href": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=H72E2s9p7Pk",
    "desc": "Info:\n\n\ud83c\udfa7     Gibran Alcocer   Idea 10 Piano Mix    1 Hour Loop  \n \nIt was a cool evening, with autumn's golden leaves falling gently to the ground. The sunset painted the sky in shades of crimson and orange as the city slowly cloaked itself in darkness. In a small restaurant by the window, flickering candlelight danced on the tables, while the walls were adorned with paintings from a bygone era. This place, where two people would share the most intimate moment of their lives, held a warm atmosphere filled with the echoes of the past.\n\nDefne and Emre had visited this restaurant many times over the years. Every table held memories\u2014happy days, moments of joy, even small arguments... But tonight was different. Tonight was their last dinner together.\n\nWhen Emre sat across from Defne, his eyes filled with unshed tears. His heart was not ready to accept this farewell. But life sometimes requires making the hardest decisions. There was sadness in Defne's eyes, but there was also a calmness, a dignity in how she faced this farewell. The soft music of the restaurant filled the room, as if trying to ease their pain.\n\nIn the center of the table stood a delicate vase of white roses. Emre had chosen these roses specifically. White symbolized purity and innocence\u2014the purest and most innocent form of their love. But it also took on a meaning as a symbol of their parting.\n\nThe first course was served, and they both tried to savor the food. But each bite felt like a drop of sorrow falling into their hearts. Defne reached out and gently squeezed Emre's hand. \"I will remember this moment forever,\" she said. Her voice trembled slightly, but the determination in her eyes showed that she had come to terms with this farewell.\n\nEmre did everything he could not to hurt her. \"You know,\" Emre began, never breaking eye contact with Defne, \"I fell in love with you here for the first time. That day, sitting in this restaurant with you, I imagined spending a lifetime together.\" Defne's eyes filled with tears, but she did not cry. Because tonight was not a time for mourning, but a celebration of the deep love they had for each other.\n\nThroughout the meal, they shared beautiful memories from the past. The day they first met, the vacations they took together, the sweet words they exchanged... Each memory made their love more meaningful, and saying goodbye even harder.\n\nWhen dessert arrived, Emre pulled out a small box from his pocket. Inside was a delicate gold bracelet, inscribed with the words, \"Always in my heart.\" Defne could no longer hold back her tears as she accepted this final gift. As Emre fastened the bracelet around her wrist, he whispered, \"This is our eternity. Though we may be apart in body, our souls will always be together.\"\n\nThen came the moment they had both been avoiding all night. The moment of parting. As they walked towards the door of the restaurant, it felt as though time had stopped. Outside, a cold wind was blowing, but inside, they felt the warmth of the love they had for each other. Emre took Defne in his arms one last time and placed a gentle kiss on her hair. \"I will always love you,\" he whispered. Defne rested her head on his chest and took a deep breath. \"I know,\" was all she said. Because sometimes words fail to capture the depth of the heart.\n\nAs Emre let go of Defne for the last time, a single tear rolled down his cheek. But it was not a tear of sorrow, but of gratitude; gratitude for the years they spent together, for the memories they shared, and most importantly, for the pure love they had for each other.\n\nAs the night wore on, Defne walked away. Emre watched her go for the last time, and then left with an emptiness in his heart. But he knew that this emptiness would never fully be filled. Because some loves are not completed by time, but only in eternity.\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Wear headphones for the optimal experience!\n\nTags:\n  #LastDinner #RomanticFarewell #SorrowfulLove #HeartbreakingLoveStory #EmotionalGoodbye #RomanticEvening #LoveAndLoss #DeepConnection #TimelessLove #BittersweetMemories #HeartfeltStory #LoveEternal #FarewellDinner #RomanticStory #GoodbyeLove\n \nANIMATIONS:\n\nVideo animated by team: ByN\n   Epic Music Galaxy Family\n\n\nI am not creator/owner of audio and wallpaper you see in this video!\nIf you want to use music that is promoted in this video, then please contact with music owner(s)!\nIf you are owner of this music/wallpaper and you want this video to be removed from youtube, then please contact with our channel through facebook or gmail and we will remove video immediately after receiving your request.\nLicense to use this music and artwork (wallpaper) in this video was given directly from owner(s)/artist(s).",

You practice gratitude. And you practice\". Shinsuke's arrival is one of the most pivotal moments for Haikyuu, that took everything that the events of the previous matches, in particular Karasuno vs Aoba Johsai, and turned it into something even more beautiful.\n\nKarasuno vs Inarizaki is one of the most intense arcs I've ever seen, from moments such as Hinata's receive, Tanaka's spike and even \"Let's take it easy\", it's packed full of some of my favourite moments in anime. \n\n#haikyuu\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Intro\n00:54 Shinsuke's Arrival\n02:47 Shinsuke's Philosophy\n04:42 Kageyama and Atsumu's Talent\n07:10 \"I am the sum of the...\"\n08:46 \"Why do people get nervous?\"\n11:10 The final piece\n13:30 Shinsuke's Job\n14:21 Post spoiler\n\nLinks:\n\nTwitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0lessonsofanime\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDiscord: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0discord\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPatreon: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0membership\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBackup Channel:   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@lfa2\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMusic used: \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Haikyuu!!\u00a0-\u00a0Inarizaki's\u00a0Cheer\u00a0|\u00a0Squad...\u00a0\u00a0 \u202a@DudesCover\u202c\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Haikyuu!!\u00a0S4\u00a0Episode\u00a020\u00a0&\u00a025\u00a0OST\u00a0-\u00a0Lo...\u00a0\u00a0 \u202a@DudesCover\u202c\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Haikyuu!!\u00a0S4\u00a0Episode\u00a020\u00a0&\u00a025\u00a0OST\u00a0-\u00a0Lo...\u00a0\u00a0 \u202a@DudesCover\u202c\nhttps://pixabay.com/music/beautiful-p...\nhttps://pixabay.com/music/beautiful-p...\nhttps://pixabay.com/music/build-up-sc...\nhttps://pixabay.com/music/beautiful-p...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Haikyuu!!\u00a0S4\u00a0Episode\u00a020\u00a0&\u00a025\u00a0OST\u00a0-\u00a0Lo...\u00a0\u00a0 \u202a@DudesCover\u202c",

    "desc": "Hinata's Brazil arc is without doubt my favourite training arc of all time. Haikyuu is packed to the brim with inspiring stories, and this arc is perhaps the most moving of all. From the end of Karasuno vs Kamomedai, where Takeda told him \"This is still Volleyball\", to his graduation and then moving to Brazil to practice beach volleyball, Hinata went on a crazy journey, which we'll discuss today.\n\nHinata's trip to Brazil didnt start the way he hoped, his roommate ignored him, the sand took away his jumping power... and yet he continued on.\n\nAfter a particularly awful day, where he had his wallet stolen he becomes overwhelmed by homesickness. But it's here he remembers Takeda's words, \"He who would climb the ladder, must start at the bottom\". Said to him during the ball boy arc, a reminder of his need to work his way up. But more importantly, to take care of himself. After collapsing halfway through the Kamomedai match, and being told by Hoshiumi to \"play him again\", he goes on a whole new path. One where he prioritises taking care of himself. Lifting weights, meditating, eating good food. All things we should do ourselves.\n\nAfter meeting up with Oikawa, and playing matches of beach volleyball together, including the final of a tournament, Hinata heads home and joins the MSBY Black Jackacls, where they play the Schweiden Adlers, featuring Kageyama, Ushiwaka, Hoshiumi and more.\n\nHinata kicks off the match with a reverse tempo set with teammate Miya Atsumu, resulting in his iconic \"I'm here\"! line. And as the match continutes, \"Ninja Shoyo\" takes over the court. Being able to fight against a world-class ace like Romero, recieving even Ushiwaka's hate filled spike, and showing himself to be a secret setter. But most importantly, at the very end, he manages to beat Kageyama. Showing that everything that happened this whole time, was \"Still volleyball\".\n\nMUSIC:\n\nAll other music not mentioned below is either by https://pixabay.com/users/lexin_music... or in YouTube's sound library.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Haikyuu!!\u00a0S4\u00a0Episode\u00a022\u00a0&\u00a024\u00a0OST\u00a0-\u00a0Pi...\u00a0\u00a0 \u202a@DudesCover\u202c\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Haikyuu!!\u00a0Season\u00a04\u00a0OST\u00a0-\u00a0Seagulls\u00a0/\u00a0H...\u00a0\u00a0 \u202a@DudesCover\u202c\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Haikyuu!!\u00a0S4\u00a0Episode\u00a022\u00a0OST\u00a0-\u00a0Hunger\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0 \u202a@DudesCover\u202c \n\nLINKS:\n\nSecond Channel: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@lfa2\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTwitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0lessonsofanime\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDiscord: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0discord\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPatreon: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0membership\u00a0\u00a0",

    "desc": "Oikawa's \"Chance Ball\" scene is one of Haikyuu's greatest, but it's just a small part of his incredible journey. As perhaps the most motivating character in the anime, his journey as an \"Ordinary setter\" to fight against Karasuno's Kageyama, and Aoba Johsai's Shiratorizawa is beyond inspiring.\n\nFrom the first match of Aoba Johsai vs Karasuno, where his serves were near-unstoppable, we see Oikawa's drastic development before the season 2 rematch. He's a completely different player, with a whole new mindset that he picked up from his mentor Jose Blanco, he turns into an absolute monster.\n\nHe's completely overcome his past - which we see in the flashback he has to his middle school days, where he almost hit Kageyama out of anger.\n\nAnd yet, in spite of all of that, he ends the second season, his time at high school, with no appearances at nationals. And yet when he finds Ushiwaka, he declares that his \"Volleyball career isn't close to over yet\".\n\n(Spoilers in this paragraph) We see him in the background of the Karasuno vs Inaraizaki match, but we otherwise don't see him - until MUCH later on, post Haikyuu's timeskip - where he and Hinata meet in Brazil to play Beach Volleyball. Further down the line, Oikawa joins Argentina's national team under the leadership of Jose Blanco, where they then play Japan.

    "desc": "The Secret to Coding Is Thinking Like A Programmer, Which I will explain In this video.\n\nThis video is all about the learning process and the mindset you need to become a successful programmer or learn to code in general. Sometimes we need a reminder on most basic things that we have already heard a million times. This video won't make you a professional coder/programmer, but I hope it helps at least even one person to have the right mindset. This is how to think like a GENIUS programmer. \n\nHUGE inspiration from: Fireship, BigBoxSWE, TheCodingSloth, ModernIdeas, and ThisScience. They're amazing YouTubers, that you should check out. I loved their content and tried my best to make a mix of their styles.\n\nHere's some SEO Spam:\nThis video is similar to fireship's,  How to learn to code - 8 hard truths, Or the coding sloth's, Learn How to Code Like a GENIUS and Not Waste Time. I was also inspired by BigBoxSwe's video: How to code everyday. So if you like those videos made by fireship, thecodingsloth, or bigboxswe, you might like this one. I also took huge inspiration from modern ideas and this.science. Overall this video is similar to fireship, thecodingsloth and bigboxswe, except it's made by lattice! So if you watched videos like, this is why programming is hard for you, or 20 programming projects that will make you good at coding or 9 programming lessons I wish I knew earlier, or you don't have to be smart to code. Then you will probably like this video too. This video is inspired by videos like: How I would learn to code if I could start over, Why you shouldn't nest your code, and naming things in code, reality of software engineering interns, how to become a coding machine, the art of linux clis, reality of cs majors, mindset of successful programmers, stop studying programming and much more. Overall, huge thanks to fireship, thecodingsloth and bigboxswe for the inspiration and I hope you enjoy this video.\n Topics Covered:\n- Analysis of trends in programming careers\n- What makes developers unhappy?\n- Should I become a programmer?\n- Should I get a CS degree?\n- Drawbacks for working as a programmer\n- Job outlook for software engineers\nEditing inspired by: ModernIdeas, This.science, BigBoxSWE\n\nMusic Used:\nSong: RedLionProduction - Comedy Episode (No Copyright Music)\nMusic provided by Tunetank.\nFree Download: https://bit.ly/2X5IRsd\nVideo Link:    \u2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0RedLionProduction\u00a0-\u00a0Comedy\u00a0Episode\u00a0(S...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nArthur Benson - Provided to YouTube by Epidemic Sound\n#programming #code #coding #webdevelopment #computerscience",

I tried my best to capture the horrors that Jebediah Schlatt, also known as JschlattLive and Big Guy, committed, but I merely grazed the surface. Schlagg is a so called \"streamer\" and \"YouTuber\" but that's simply a facade. He hides behind his fellow content creators, like Ted Nivison and the dream smp just so he doesn't have to face the horrendous things he did on 1999. But 1999 is just the start, there are rumors that Schlatt had certain connections to the Queen's unfortunate demise.

Unlike traditional AI models that rely on large datasets and algorithms to classify or predict outcomes, generative AI models are designed to learn the underlying patterns and structure of the data and generate novel outputs that mimic human creativity.\n\nChatGPT is perhaps the most well-known example, but the field is far larger and more varied than text generation. Other applications of generative AI include image and video synthesis, speech generation, music composition, and virtual reality.\n\nIn this lecture, Mirella Lapata will present an overview of this exciting\u2014sometimes controversial\u2014and rapidly evolving field.\n\nMirella Lapata is professor of natural language processing in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. Her research focuses on getting computers to understand, reason with, and generate natural language. She is the first recipient (2009) of the British Computer Society and Information Retrieval Specialist Group (BCS/IRSG) Karen Sparck Jones award and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the ACL, and Academia Europaea.\n\n00:00 Intro\n2:38 Generative AI isn\u2019t new \u2013 so what\u2019s changed?\n8:43 How did we get to ChatGPT?\n12:38 How are Large Language Models created?\n22:48 How good can a LLM become?\n26:57 Unexpected effects of scaling up LLMs\n28:05 How can ChatGPT meet the needs of humans?\n32:30 Chat GPT demo\n38:07 Are Language Models always right or fair?\n40:21 The impact of LLMs on society\n42:54 Is AI going to kill us all?\n\n--\nA very special thank you to our Patreon supporters who help make these videos happen, especially: \n\nmodsiw, Anton Ragin, Edward Unthank, Robert L Winer, Andy Carpenter, William Hudson\nDon McLaughlin, efkinel lo, Martin Paull, Ben Wynne-Simmons, Ivo Danihelka, Kevin Winoto, Jonathan Killin, Stephan Giersche, William Billy Robillard, Jeffrey Schweitzer, Frances Dunne, jonas.app, Tim Karr, Alan Latteri, David Crowner, Matt Townsend, THOMAS N TAMADA, Andrew McGhee, Paul Brown, David Schick, Dave Ostler, Osian Gwyn Williams, David Lindo, Roger Baker, Rebecca Pan\n--\n\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0ri_science\u00a0\u00a0\nand Facebook: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0royalinstitution\u00a0\u00a0\nand TikTok: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0ri_science\u00a0\u00a0\nListen to the Ri podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/sh...\nOur editorial policy: https://www.rigb.org/editing-ri-talks...\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http://bit.ly/RiNewsletter\n\nProduct links on this page may be affiliate links which means it won't cost you any extra but we may earn a small commission if you decide to purchase through the link.",

He has been an AI researcher for more than 30 years, and has published more than 400 scientific articles on the subject. He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of AI (AAAI), and a Fellow of the European Association for AI (EurAI).\n\n-----\n\nDiscourses are one of the Ri\u2019s oldest and most prestigious series of talks. Since 1825, audiences in the theatre have witnessed countless mind-expanding moments, including the first public liquefaction of air by James Dewar, the announcement of the electron by JJ Thomson and over 100 lectures by Michael Faraday. In more recent times, we have had Nobel laureates, Fields medal winners, scientists, authors and artists \u2013 all from the cutting-edge of their field. Discourses are an opportunity for the best and brightest to share their work with the world.\n\nSteeped in nearly two centuries of tradition, a Discourse is more than just a lecture. The Discourse lasts exactly an hour, and a bell is rung to mark the beginning and end. To keep the focus on the topic, presenters begin sharply at 7:30pm without introduction and we lock the speaker into a room ten minutes ahead of the start (legend has it that a speaker once tried to escape!). Some of our guests and speakers dress smartly for our Discourse events to add to this sense of occasion.

Because of this, the standard internet alone will not suffice in allowing us to access this quantum information; a quantum internet must be developed to keep up with the immense increase in computational power.\n\nJoin Kian van der Enden as he explores how we can build the internet the future will need, a quantum internet and whether it will be truly unhackable.\n\nIn this talk, discover everything about this exciting technology and its applications both for the quantum and current internet. From the usefulness of quantum teleportation to how this could shape our world.\n\n--\n\nKian van der Enden obtained his Master's degree in Applied Physics at the TU Delft. During his studies he co-founded the Delft Hyperloop team where he designed and built its signature magnetic levitation system, leading it to a championship victory in Elon Musk's \u2018SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition\u2018 in 2017. Following this, he worked at Microsoft's Quantum Architecture department as Research Intern in 2018 after graduating at QuTech on the development of a magnetic field insensitive superconducting qubit.\n\nKian is now building the world's first metropolitan scale Quantum Internet in the Hanson lab, where he aims to demonstrate a scalable and reliable hardware platform as the start of a future European Quantum Internet.\n\nKian is also one of the QuTech Speakers. He gives talks to various audiences of all backgrounds and is often requested to appear on podcasts and TV shows.

    "desc": "Are there limits to what computers can do? How complex is too complex for computation? The question of how hard a problem is to solve lies at the heart of an important field of computer science called Computational Complexity. Computational complexity theorists want to know which problems are practically solvable using clever algorithms and which problems are truly difficult, maybe even virtually impossible, for computers to crack. This hardness is central to what\u2019s called the P versus NP problem, one of the most difficult and important questions in all of math and science. \n\nThis video covers a wide range of topics including: the history of computer science, how transistor-based electronic computers solve problems using Boolean logical operations and algorithms, what is a Turing Machine, the different classes of problems, circuit complexity, and the emerging field of meta-complexity, where researchers study the self-referential nature of complexity questions. \n\nFeaturing computer scientist Scott Aaronson (full disclosure, he is also member of the Quanta Magazine Board).

    "desc": "Hagoromo has been described as \"the Rolls-Royce\" of chalk.\" The formerly Japanese, now Korean brand's chalk is known for its smooth consistency, vibrancy, and being nearly dust-free. But the brand almost disappeared in 2015, which sent its loyal fans into a frenzy, buying up lifetime supplies before the factory shut down. Luckily, Shin Hyeong-seok, a Korean schoolteacher and former seller of Hagoromo chalk, formed a relationship with the company's president, Watanabe Takayasu, and decided to take over. The transition wasn't easy, but Hyeong-seok's dedication to Takayasu's original formulas and methodology kept the brand alive. But is that enough to ensure its future? We visited Sejongmall, where Hagoromo chalk is made, to find out. \n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE VIDEOS:\nWhy Michelin-Starred Chefs Are Paying Premium For One Of Korea's Rarest Seaweeds | So Expensive\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Why\u00a0Michelin-Starred\u00a0Chefs\u00a0Are\u00a0Paying...\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy India's $12 Million Cricket Bat Industry Is Fueled By UK Trees | So Expensive | Business Insider\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Why\u00a0India's\u00a0$12\u00a0Million\u00a0Cricket\u00a0Bat\u00a0I...\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy These Giant Oak Barrels Are The Key To Making Some Of The World's Most Expensive Wine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Why\u00a0These\u00a0Giant\u00a0Oak\u00a0Barrels\u00a0Are\u00a0The\u00a0K...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#chalk #soexpensive #businessinsider \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nBusiness Insider on Facebook: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0businessinsider\u00a0\u00a0 Business Insider on Instagram: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0insiderbusiness\u00a0\u00a0 Business Insider on Twitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0businessinsider\u00a0\u00a0 \nBusiness Insider on Snapchat: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a05319643143\u00a0\u00a0\nBusiness Insider on TikTok: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0businessinsider\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhy Hagoromo Chalk Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider",

    "desc": "On satellite imagery, we spotted a village inside a strange crater in Madagascar. We set out to learn how it got there.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRight in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there\u2019s a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris \u2014 and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there\u2019s a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. \n\nWhen we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It\u2019s a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. \n\nCheck out an extended look at the interviews in this video: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Bonus\u00a0interviews:\u00a0What\u2019s\u00a0inside\u00a0this\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:\n\nHere is some of Michel J\u00e9brak\u2019s research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publicat...\n\nHere is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi\u2019s original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publicat...\n\nWe also spoke with Stian Rice, author of Famine in the Remaking, who helped us understand more about the history of agriculture in Madagascar:  https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/01/2...\n\nCheck out Stian\u2019s book on famine and food systems: https://wvupressonline.com/node/831\n\nNorman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell\u2019s SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/\n\nCorrection: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilm\u00e9 as a professor of geology at the University of Florida. In fact, she is a national coordinator of the Madagascar Program at the World Resources Institute. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

So companies own equipment, so then they're responsible for maintenance and for what happens, either for extending life, which would be very much to their advantage, or for recycling, ending life.\n\nGael Duez 00:37\nHello everyone, welcome to Green IO with Gael Duez - that\u2019s me! In this podcast we empower responsible technologists to build a greener digital world, one byte at a time. Twice a month on a Tuesday, our guests from across the globe share insights, tools, and alternative approaches, enabling people within the Tech sector and beyond, to boost Digital Sustainability.\n\nAnd because accessible and transparent information is in the DNA of Green IO, all the references mentioned in this episode, as well as the transcript, will be in the show notes. You can find these notes on your favorite podcast platform, and, of course, on our website greenio.tech.\n\nCan the data center industry become circular? Simple question, very complex answers.\n\nFueled by the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, data centers are popping up around the world like mushrooms after a good rain. For an industry which is more and more under scrutiny due to its environmental footprint, the sustainability angle cannot be overlooked anymore. Still, the main hurdle remains data, as many guests already stated in this podcast. Hence, my wish today to get insights from the program leader of an initiative which has managed to build high quality primary data on the data center industry. The CEDaCI project sounds like a Dan Brown book title, CEDaCI code to unveil all the mysterious power beneath our almighty data center industry. And to some extent, it's quite the plot. But I will let Deborah Andrews, professor at the Imperial College of London and a two decades long veteran in Circular Economy and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment reveal all of it.\u00a0\nHi, Deborah. Thanks a lot for joining Green IO today.\n\nDeborah Andrews 02:32\nThank you very much for inviting me.\n\nGael Duez 02:35\nIt's a pleasure. It's a pleasure. And I have a very direct question to ask you to kick start our discussion. Did you start the CEDaCI project out of frustration somehow?\n\nDeborah Andrews 02:49\nOkay, well, first of all, thank you for calling CEDaCI. That's the Italian interpretation. We normally describe it as CEDaCI, but hey ho, it's an acronym for the Circ...",

But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. \n\nWhat happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF\u2019s Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures\u200b\u200b) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens. A few standout findings so far:\n\nWater can become a hot black ice that conducts electricity: https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-...\n\nHydrogen gas can be compressed down into a shiny metal: https://www.newscientist.com/article/...\n\nSodium (a soft, silvery metal at atmospheric pressure) can turn transparent: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...\n\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://cmap.rochester.edu/\n\nWhat happens under extreme pressures deep with planets also influences their ability to foster life.

Things like \"=B4/B2\" should have been \"=B4/$B$2\" so I could drag the formula down. We took that out in the interest of clarity.\n- Yes, at 13:20 I say \"the divisor ceases to lose some of its strict meaning\" which is the opposite of what I meant! the sentence needs but the one negative. Either of these would work: \"the divisor loses some of its strict meaning\" OR \"the divisor ceases to have some of its strict meaning\".\n- Sorry, at 16:47 column D is wrong. These are different numbers using 880 but the values over in E use the correct 930. It's just a display issue and does not change the results (despite being a bit confusing!). Spotted by a few people including Thomas Klemm  and AverageJon.\n- People have mentioned that Theorem 2 (and the conclusion) from this 1974 paper by Balinski & Young has an Alabama-paradox-beating method. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.71.11.4602\n- Let me know if you spot anything else.\n\nFilming and editing by Alex Genn-Bash\nAnimations by William Marler http://wmad.co.uk/\nVoice work by Ben Moor and Destin Sandlin.

The CIA recruited him while he was applying to join the Peace Corps after leaving the US Air Force. Bustamante possesses an intimate knowledge of the intelligence community's inner workings. He says that he orchestrated several drone strikes during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and that he mastered the art of deception. After meeting his wife, also a CIA officer, and having children, he learned the CIA was no place for families. But leaving a life that was, to most people, a lie wasn't easy. Today, he runs his own company, Everyday Spy, training people in the techniques he learned as a spy.

While deep undercover in hot spots such as Florida, Colombia, and Panama, Mazur successfully infiltrated criminal rings and cartels, including Pablo Escobar's, by posing as a wealthy, mob-connected businessman. He helped manage the illicit fortunes of the Medell\u00edn and Cali cartels while gathering evidence that would lead to some of the largest money-laundering prosecutions in history.\n\nHe speaks to Insider about how the cartels layer their assets, and move money via \u201csmurfs\u201d. He also covers the use of legitimate businesses, such as jewellery chains and mortgage brokerage companies.\n\nMazur is the author of \"The Infiltrator,\" which became a New York Times bestseller and inspired a 2016 film of the same title, starring Bryan Cranston (as Mazur) and John Leguizamo. Cranston is set to play Mazur again in the sequel currently in development, which is based on Mazur' second memoir, \"The Betrayal.\u201d Today, Mazur speaks and consults around the world through his company, KYC Solutions. \n\nFor more information about Mazur's speaking, expert witness, and consulting services, visit:\nhttps://www.robertmazur.com/\n\nRead his latest memoir, \"The Betrayal,\" about his second undercover operation on the inside of the Cali cartel:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-Story...\n\nRead his first memoir, \"The Infiltrator,\" about his time investigating the Medell\u00edn cartel:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Infiltrator-Ag...\n00:00- Introduction\n00:48 - Chapter 1 | Creating the Persona\n01:59 - Chapter 2 | Meeting the Cartel\n03:27 - Chapter 3 | The Market\n05:13 - Chapter 4 | Collecting the Cash\n07:15 - Chapter 5 | Making Payments\n09:43 - Chapter 6 | The Surveillance\n12:17 - Chapter 7 | The Banks\n15:13- Chapter 8 | The Middlemen\n16:20 - Chapter 9 | Breaking Cover\n17:57- Chapter 10 | The Aftermath\n19:39- Chapter 11 | The Future of Dirty Money\n\nMORE HOW CRIME WORKS VIDEOS:\nHow Diamond Heists Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How\u00a0Diamond\u00a0Heists\u00a0Actually\u00a0Work\u00a0|\u00a0Ho...\u00a0\u00a0\nHow 8 Crimes Actually Work (From Bank Robbery to the New York Mafia)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How\u00a08\u00a0Crimes\u00a0Actually\u00a0Work\u00a0\u2014\u00a0From\u00a0Ban...\u00a0\u00a0\nHow The Triads (Hong Kong Mafia) Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How\u00a0The\u00a0Triads\u00a0(Hong\u00a0Kong\u00a0Mafia)\u00a0Actu...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#insider #crime #money #researched\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

    "desc": "Join us for a tour of Micron Technology\u2019s Taiwan chip manufacturing facilities to discover how chips are produced and how innovations in the semiconductor industry impact people and businesses all over the world.\n\nTake a look inside one of the semiconductor factories that make Taiwan the most significant site of semiconductor production in the world. Thanks to modern technology and constant innovations, chip manufacturing advances at a rapid pace. Today, each silicon microchip contains over 100 billion transistors, the switches that make up the basic units of computing. Each transistor is just a few nanometers in size, making them a fraction of the size of a human hair.\n\nThis means that even the slightest contamination can halt the entire chip production process. In fact, the semiconductor manufacturing process contains over 1,000 steps, all of which must be executed perfectly to produce functional chips. In Micron\u2019s mega factory, silicon wafers are processed with incredible precision. The dustless factory is highly automated, which minimizes the number of humans required to enter. Each silicon wafer is coated in a UV-sensitive liquid, then etched using photolithography. We exhibit the entire process here in high resolution, giving you an inside look into the workings of one of the most high-tech factories in the world.\n\nMicron Technology is a global leader in the semiconductor industry and produces leading-edge memory products. Its neighbor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) produces industry-leading logic technology. These two companies constitute a large portion of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry, which spans the island from north to south. As they grow and continue to innovate, their products require more and more resources to produce, putting increasing pressure on the environment. Micron leaders share how they are expanding their innovative approach into the area of resource management, enabling them to create more sustainable products.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Taiwan\u2019s Semiconductor Mega Factories\n01:10 Micron Technology\u2019s Factory Operations Center\n02:39 Silicon Transistors: The Basic Units of All Computing\n04:34 Taiwan\u2019s Chip Production Facilities\n05:47 Micron Technology\u2019s Mega Factory in Taiwan\n08:00 Semiconductor Design: Developing the Architecture for Integrated Circuits\n08:45 Micron\u2019s Dustless Fabrication Facility\n11:06 Wafer Processing With Photolithography\n13:13 Automation Optimizes Deliver Efficiency\n14:50 Monitoring Machines from the Remote Operations Center\n16:37 Transforming Chips Into Usable Components\n18:41 Mitigating the Environmental Effects of Chip Production\n21:40 A World of Ceaseless Innovation\n22:30 End Credits\n\nHow TSMC Became Taiwan\u2019s Silicon Shield? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0TSMC:\u00a0Taiwan\u2019s\u00a0Semiconductor\u00a0Market\u00a0G...\u00a0\u00a0\n#Micron #TSMC #Semiconductor #Taiwan #MegaFactories #TaiwanPlus #Microchips #Microchip\n\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2581 \n\n\ud83c\udf0f TaiwanPlus | Taiwan to the World\nBreaking news and original programs.

Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nBest documentary winner: Denver International Film Festival (2017), Warsaw International Film Festival (2017), and Traverse City Film Festival (2017).\n\nOfficial selection at Tribeca Film Festival (2017), BFI London Film Festival (2017), and Critics' Choice Documentary Awards (2017).\n\nFind out more: https://www.alphagomovie.com/\n\n--\n\n\"I want my style of Go to be something different, something new, my own thing, something that no one has thought of before.\" Lee Sedol, Go Champion (18 World Titles).\n\n\"We think of DeepMind as kind of an Apollo program effort for AI. Our mission is to fundamentally understand intelligence and recreate it artificially.\" Demis Hassabis, Co-Founder & CEO, DeepMind.\n\n\"The Game of Go is the holy grail of artificial intelligence. Everything we've ever tried in AI, it just falls over when you try the game of Go.\" Dave Silver, Lead Researcher for AlphaGo.",

But at the same time, it\u2019s also considered one of the best comedies. This man mastered the prank far before youtube pranks became popular. Because what makes Borat so unique is that it features real people, who have no idea he is playing a character. He goes extremely far with his humour, often violating social boundaries and taboos.

The truth is that the first people to introduce a paradigm-shift almost always face persecution, and many are overshadowed by the less-controversial minds who follow them.\n\nSuch is the case of Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor who fought a lifelong battle against a disease he couldn\u2019t see and that the medical establishment repeatedly told him wasn\u2019t real. How does a scientist or doctor combat bacteria when they don\u2019t even know it exists? The epidemics bacteria, viruses, and germs brought to innocent hospital patients wracked hospitals of the day, but the history of medicine is as much one of complacency and cosmic explanations as it is about breakthroughs.\n\nIgnaz Semmelweis used incredible powers of logic and deductive reasoning to isolate a problem so complex that it stymied all the scientific minds of continental Europe, first by examining data within the clinics of his own hospital, and then identifying the source of infection. Through years of refining an antiseptic regimen that would end up saving an incalculable number of lives -- and paving the way for better-known scientific giants like Lister and Pasteur -- Semmelweis compiled one of the era\u2019s great medical texts, one that would change healthcare worldwide.\n\nAnd for that, he was ridiculed, criticized, fired, dismissed, institutionalized, and beaten to de*th. The shocking story of Ignaz Semmelweis is the real story of scientific progress.\n\n** Additional Reading **\n\nSemmelweis, Ignaz. \u201cThe Etiology, Concept, and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever,\u201d 1861; Translated by K.

We were building on our knowledge of asteroids, the discovery of Neptune, and understanding the transit of Venus, and science fiction like Jules Verne's \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" was taking our imagination deep inside our own planet.\n\nBut one man rejected the long march of seemingly-irrefutable scientific progress. The cult leader Cyrus Teed was convinced that we weren't living amidst a complex solar system, and that we weren't on top of the Earth at all. Cyrus Teed thought that we were living inside the Earth.\n\nTeed's Koreshan movement focused on the concept of a hollow earth, and he set out to prove scientifically that we were living on a concave surface inside of a giant hollow ball. From the religious awakenings of Upstate New York to Chicago to a swamp in Florida, Cyrus Teed gained converts who believed in his science and his religion. But did the rectilineator Teed built to conduct his painstaking measurements prove that we're really living inside, or did they just prove that Teed and his followers were insane?\n\n#popularscience #science #education",

And that might even be a good thing.\n\nWe\u2019ve recognized psychopathy in science and culture for thousands of years, yet we still don\u2019t know what to do about it. Yet we use the word itself now more than ever, so much that the meaning of the word \u201cpsychopath\u201d has become diluted in popular culture. As we increasingly learn more about the science of psychopathy, we should get better at deploying the term more accurately -- but instead, it\u2019s become a catch-all for unconscionable human behavior and a mainstay of true crime stories.\n\nPsychopaths are much more complex than that\u2026 for better and worse.\n\nIn reality, a psychopath\u2019s brain creates and perpetually reinforces a moral code that is defined more by what it lacks than what it contains. From a total absence of anxiety to a simple utilitarian worldview that can do tremendous harm to others, the psychopath is a mix of brute force and the most subtle manipulation. And this is where it gets really complicated: you actually want the ruthlessness of a psychopath to run your company, you want the charm of a psychopath for investigative journalism, and you want the fearlessness of a psychopath to respond to medical emergencies.\n\nCan we harness the biological and psychological forces that create dangerous, destructive psychopaths to improve humanity? And if we could cure or eliminate psychopathy\u2026 would we even want to?\n\nADDITIONAL READING\n\nKiehl, Kent. \u201cThe Psychopath Whisperer: The Science of Those Without Conscience.\u201d https://www.amazon.com/Psychopath-Whi...\n\nDutton, Kevin. \u201cThe Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success.\u201d https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Psychop...\n** CREDITS **\n\nVsauce2:\nTwitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0vsaucetwo\u00a0\u00a0\nInstagram: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0kevlieber\u00a0\u00a0\nFacebook: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0vsaucetwo\u00a0\u00a0\nTikTok: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0vsaucetwo\u00a0\u00a0\nTalk Vsauce2 in The Create Unknown Discord: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0discord\u00a0\u00a0\nVsauce2 on Reddit: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0vsauce2\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHosted and Produced by Kevin Lieber\nTwitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0kevinlieber\u00a0\u00a0\nPodcast: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0thecreateunknown\u00a0\u00a0\n\nResearch and Writing by Matthew Tabor\n\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0tabortcu\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEditing by John Swan\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@johnswanyt\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHuge Thanks To Paula Lieber\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/Craftality\n\nVsauce's Curiosity Box: https://www.curiositybox.com/\n#psychology #truecrime #psychopath #mentalhealth #science",

Everyone knows of \u201cLysenkoism\u201d regarding the USSR\u2019s failed theories of genetics, but Trofim Lysenko\u2019s lifelong body work was driven by a perfect combination of history, revolution, political theory, power, and personalities.\n\nLysenko\u2019s impact on Russian biology was a direct result of crafting science -- and scientists -- in service of Vladimir Lenin\u2019s new Soviet man at a time when the international scientific community was making tremendous progress on genetics and biology. But to Lysenko and Josef Stalin, the real science was in the potential of plants and animals to behave like Soviet citizens.\n\nThat led Russia and its scientists down a path that derailed progress for decades. But what if Lysenko\u2019s theories on the inheritance of acquired traits actually have merit? A resurgence of support for Lysenko has gone beyond the grim history of science to look at what we know about altering the expression of DNA and how a human\u2019s experiences in life can even affect their grandchildren. The truth is that modern genetics has little to nothing to do with Lysenko, but the specter of his pseudoscience continues to haunt the disciplines of genetics and biology -- and science as a whole.\n\n** SOURCES / ADDITIONAL READING **\n\n\u201cLysenko\u2019s Ghost: Epigenetics and Russia\u201d by Loren Graham: https://bit.ly/3ReCEpT\n\n\u201cA People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution: 1891-1924\u201d by Orlando Figes: https://bit.ly/4a8Ti32\n\n\u201cStalin and the Scientists: A History of Triumph and Tragedy\u201d by Simon Ings: https://amzn.to/3RwD5NE\n** CREDITS **\n\nVsauce2\nTwitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0vsaucetwo\u00a0\u00a0\nInstagram: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0kevlieber\u00a0\u00a0\nFacebook: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0vsaucetwo\u00a0\u00a0\nTikTok: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0vsaucetwo\u00a0\u00a0\nTalk Vsauce2 in The Create Unknown Discord: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0discord\u00a0\u00a0\nVsauce2 on Reddit: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0vsauce2\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHosted and Produced by Kevin Lieber\nTwitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0kevinlieber\u00a0\u00a0\nPodcast: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0thecreateunknown\u00a0\u00a0\n\nResearch and Writing by Matthew Tabor\n\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0tabortcu\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEditing by John Swan\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@johnswanyt\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHuge Thanks To Paula Lieber\n\nVsauce's Curiosity Box: https://www.curiositybox.com/\n#science #scientist #history",

Early attempts to reach it were primarily motivated by the search for a navigable route through the Arctic to Asia, known as the Northwest Passage. Later, explorers focused specifically on reaching the Pole itself. But for centuries, reaching it seemed impossible. The polar environment was extremely unforgiving. Located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, the North Pole is covered by a vast expanse of sea ice which constantly changes due to wind, ocean currents and seasonal melts. Explorers tried to reach the pole using ships, dogsleds, and even traveling by foot. The first verified, and officially recognized expedition to reach the North Pole didn\u2019t occur until 1926 (although several explorers claimed to have reached it earlier). It was first reached using the airship Norge, which flew overhead, but did not land on the surface.  \n\nIn the late 1920\u2019s, accomplished explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins became convinced that a submarine would provide the ultimate means of reaching the North Pole. A submarine could travel for extended periods beneath the ice, avoiding the extreme hazards above which had caused earlier expeditions to fail. Carrying the latest scientific equipment, the submarine\u2019s crew could conduct valuable meteorological, oceanographic, biological, magnetic, and spectrographic experiments.\n\nWilkin\u2019s submarine would be called the Nautilus. It was a retired WW1-era submarine that had been extensively modified by renowned Naval Architect Simon Lake. The Nautilus featured a heavily reinforced bow, a shock absorber and sledge runners to protect it from collision with sea ice. A diving compartment and airlock was also added to allow divers to explore the depths while the submarine remained submerged. Most importantly, the Nautilus was fitted with three ice drills, allowing the submarine to recharge batteries, refresh air and even allow the crew to exit while the submarine still remained below the ice. \n\nThe Nautilus and her crew of 20 men began their expedition to the North Pole in June of 1931. \nNone of them realized how grueling their journey would be, and almost immediately things began to go wrong.",

    "desc": "Retro Dungeon Synth Ambience for roleplaying from Mountain Realm\n\ud83d\udc49Bandcamp: https://cryocrypt.bandcamp.com/album/...\n\ud83d\udc49Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/39imSZ...\n\nMountain Realm (of projects Atrium Carceri/Za Fr\u00fbmi) presents his 3rd album on Cryo Crypt. A mist filled ancient nordic folk tale fantasy that starts in the Whitebark Forest\n\nAs the last wisps of sunlight fade, the Whitebark forest succumbs to the Shadowlorn's dark grasp. The ancient trees, once verdant and proud, now stand as skeletal sentinels, their leaves withered and grey. The elves, attuned to the forest's subtle rhythms, feel the Shadowlorn's presence like an open wound, its influence seeping into the land like a chill that cannot be shaken.\n\nIn this desperate hour, whispers of a forgotten remedy begin to circulate, spoken in hushed tones around flickering campfires and in the shadowy recesses of the forest. They speak of the Ruby of the Ancients, said to hold the only hope of stemming the Shadowlorn's relentless tide. Hidden deep within the ruins of the Fallen Kingdom, the ruby's existence is a fragile thread, the last lifeline for a world on the brink of collapse.\n\nAs the stars begin their slow wheeling in the night sky, the wind stirs, carrying the whispers of the past on its breath. The Fallen Kingdom's crumbling spires, once proud and tall, now stand as a haunting testament to the transience of power. Yet, it is within these ancient stones that the ruby is said to lie, waiting for one brave enough to claim it. The darkness closes in, but the promise of the ruby remains, a desperate gamble against the Shadowlorn's crushing darkness.\n\nGather your gear, shoulder your pack, and prepare to venture into the shadows of the Fallen Kingdom, where the whispers of the past await, and the promise of the ruby beckons.\n\nRecommended for fans of Nordic Folk, retro CRPGs, and PnP RPGs. \n\n\ud83d\udc49Tracklist:\n00:00 Leaving Sanctuary\n01:47 A Journey with Old Friends\n05:15 A Circle of Faun\n08:05 Ruins Beyond the Tree Tops\n11:56 Fungi Monks of the Moon\n14:23 Beneath the Graves of my Brothers\n17:17 Bronze Key\n19:34 Lights from the Gate\n22:53 Spirit of the Elven Prince\n25:47 Fallen Kingdom\n28:56 Ruby\n30:48 Old Friend We Meet Again\n33:32 Morning Air\n36:15 Returning the Crown\n\n\ud83d\udc49Album Link Bandcamp: https://cryocrypt.bandcamp.com/album/...",

Here, our Raccoon mascot - alongside Milkshake the Bear and Mango the Toucan - settles into a new apartment, explores a new city, and surrenders to the seemingly endless Summer.

So grab a pool umbrella, find your favorite sunglasses, and turn up the boombox.\n\nAt 24 songs with 35 musicians, Essentials Summer 2022 marks the 26th seasonal compilation since beginning back in 2016.

Comparable to films like \"Megamind\" and \"Watchmen,\" \"The Incredibles\" not only entertains with its thrilling action and stunning visuals but also provokes thought with its exploration of more serious themes.

In this video, we explore why Bolt is a true masterpiece that captured the hearts of audiences but never received the sequel it deserved.\n\nReleased in 2008, Bolt tells the story of a super-powered dog who believes he has real powers, only to discover that his life as a TV star isn\u2019t what it seems. With its unique premise, heartwarming characters, and stunning animation, Bolt stands out as a shining example of Disney's storytelling magic. \n\nA big step for Disney at the time, after several questionable movies. But why didn\u2019t Bolt get a sequel? We'll dive into the reasons behind this surprising decision and explore how the movie's legacy lives on despite the lack of a follow-up. Could there still be hope for Bolt 2? Let's speculate on what a sequel might look like and why fans continue to rally for more adventures with our favorite super-dog.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a longtime Bolt fan or discovering this movie for the first time, this video is a must-watch!

She is saved by a mysterious rogue named Mugen and a young r\u014dnin named Jin. Mugen attacks Jin after he proves to be a worthy opponent. The pair begin fighting one another and inadvertently cause the death of Shibui Tomonoshina, the magistrate's son. For this crime, they are to be executed.

I am not sure what it is, but the emotions that the song shows indirectly, has made me speechless. The creative brilliance of both the track and the film, deeply touched me.\n\nI am a guy that enjoys phonk music, blasting my ears with many kinds of upbeats, but memory reboot changed and altered my gears in my music taste. \n\nIn conclusion, I was so touched by the masterpiece that I am so compelled to make a playlist matching the vibe. I've included the sped up version because it is what it is, loss for words. So many versions of the song and yet... it works. Ultimately, ending off with memory reboot slowed version to show my appreciation.\n\nSo thank you and credits to \u202a@NarventMusic\u202c  and V\u00d8J for your masterpiece.\n\nAlso big credit to creators such as \u202a@FrankJavCee\u202c \u202a@TheMotion\u202c  Home and \u202a@PASTELGHOSTx\u202c .\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMUSIC \ud83c\udfb6:\n0:00 - V\u00d8J, Narvent - Memory Reboot\n3:51 - V\u00d8J, Narvent - Lost Memory\n6:23 - HOME - resonance (slowed + reverb)\n10:26 - frankjavcee - simpsonwave1995\n12:56 - V\u00d8J, Narvent - Memory Reboot Sped Up\n15:41 - The Pixies - Where is my Mind (Synthwave) by The Motion\n19:03 - Pastel Ghost - Iris Slowed + Reverb\n23:18 - Pastel Ghost - Dark Beached slowed + reverb\n27:14 - favorite ver of memory reboot.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u270d\ufe0f INTRODUCTION:\n\nHi there!

The movie has been covered enough on Youtube, so I didn't go super in depth on the movie itself. I tried to bring something new to the table.\n\nAlso, I noticed that while the second problem in the movie has plenty of coverage, the first one has been given much less love. Hopefully my explanation was sufficient!\n\nPatreon Video coming very very soon!

    "desc": "\"Infinity is mind numbingly weird. How is it even legal to use it in calculus?\"\n\n\"After sitting through two years of AP Calculus, I still feel like I don\u2019t know anything about it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean that historically, integrals came before derivatives? Seriously, what\u2019s the deal with calculus?\"\n\nThere is an inspiring story hidden behind the formulas and word problems of single-variable calculus\u2013a story that should be told in every introductory calculus course, but usually isn\u2019t. Regardless of if you\u2019ve taken a few calculus courses before or are just beginning your study of calculus, this video aims to give a taste of the insights that can be gained from learning about the history and philosophy behind the key ideas of this field of math\u2026 brought to you by a dog and some rough animations!\n\nThis video was part of #SoME2, a math video making contest created by \u202a@3blue1brown\u202c in the summer of 2022.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Chapter 1: Infinity\n1:49 Chapter 2: The history of calculus (is actually really interesting I promise)\n2:19 Chapter 2.1: Ancient Greek philosophers hated infinity but still did integration\n7:43 Chapter 2.2: Algebra was actually kind of revolutionary\n11:14 Chapter 2.3: I now pronounce you derivative and integral. You may kiss the bride!\n19:53 Chapter 2.4: Yeah that\u2019s cool and all but isn\u2019t infinity like, evil or something\n24:14 Chapter 3: Reflections: What if they teach calculus like this?\n\n=====================================================================\n\nLINK TO FURTHER READING AND SOURCES: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K...\n\nThank you very much to Dr. David Bressoud for letting me interview him!\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions, thoughts, recommendations or you notice any mistakes, please do share!\n\n=====================================================================\n\nCORRECTIONS LIST (periodically being updated):\n\n3 : 47 I start a description of Archimedes' circle proof here, but I want to note that the one I present is a modified version of it; it does contain a few \"hand-wavy\" mistakes near the end and may still be difficult to follow; that's on me. My goal with showing this proof wasn't to give a proper explanation of it, but to give a taste of what I thought is the spirit of rigorous reasoning. If you would like to see something that is closer to Archimedes' argument, there's a link in the further reading you can check out--or you could also just google \"Archimedes circle proof\".\n\n8 : 45 I made a typo... Viete lived from 1540-1603, not 1540-1693\n\n14 : 35 This is embarrassing. Kepler's 2nd law is true because angular momentum is constant, not because velocity is constant. Whoops!\n\nA lot of comments have brought up Indian contributions to calculus that I left out, particularly the Kerala School and Madhava of Sangamagrama, where the first instances of derivation came about. A few reasons for why I missed this in my research could be because attributing the beginnings of calculus with Indian mathematicians seems like a relatively new historical narrative, and many sources in English likely have a bit of Eurocentric bias. Regardless, this goes to show how the narrative I shared does have its flaws, and similarly to the misleading impression of calculus I criticized modern introductory courses of spreading, this narrative is not the whole picture. If you have any sources you'd like me to add to the further reading, please let me know!\n\nI may have suggested that Euler discovered the number e, but he did not--some attribute it to Napier, and many others before Euler used it. On that note, I probably misleadingly attributed a lot of other ideas I brought up to one or a few people, when they are much more nuanced; so take the briefly brought up associations in this video with a grain of salt. This video is intended to share a broad narrative instead of establish definitive history of calculus. Hopefully this can just act as an intro to the subject!",

It was one of the first songs we ever wrote together and it was actually the song that really started everything for us. We recorded it in a friend's garage. At first, we only put it on Soundcloud because we thought it wasn\u2019t good enough for iTunes or Spotify. We both had normal jobs and always thought music would just be a hobby. Then this song started going viral on Soundcloud and we have been making music ever since. \n\nCoastline\nWe both grew up on the east coast of Australia. However, we actually wrote this song while we were living in Canada. We spent some time living in Toronto, very far from any coastline, and while we were there we were reminiscing on road trips up and down the east coast of Australia and this song was born. We recorded it in a little studio in Montreal, and the recording engineer must have misheard us when we told him the song name because when we looked at the computer he had titled the song \u2018Toastland\u2019. \n\nEvermore\nAbout 4 years ago, Matt\u2019s sister approached him and told him that she was struggling to find a song to walk down the aisle to on her wedding day. She asked if he could write a song for her. Of course, he said yes! So he wrote this song and performed it with his brother as she walked down the aisle. After the wedding, we both listened to the song and thought it was special. We worked on it together to try and shape it into something for Hollow Coves. The song sat with us for the next few years. \n\nBlessings\nBlessing is a song of gratitude. It\u2019s about recognizing the little blessings that life has to offer. If we don\u2019t take a moment to acknowledge them; we can often miss them. Practicing gratitude is known to be good for mental health, yet anxiety and depression seem to be more and more prevalent in our generation. I think this generation is just too distracted to stop and take time to practice gratitude. We wanted to write this song to help people to realize that there are blessings all around if you just look up and take the time to think about how much we have to be grateful for. \n\nLonely Nights\nWhen we first wrote \u2018Lonely Nights,\u2019 we were on tour in Europe and missing home. We were reminiscing on times spent with friends and lamenting missing events. Now, given the events of the last year and a half, we can\u2019t help but think that this is a feeling that so many people would have experienced, and may still be experiencing, through the COVID lockdowns and times of isolation. We hope this song can give people a sense of peace and hope for the future.\n\nHello\nThis song was actually based off one of the first songs Matt ever wrote back in school. He stumbled across the song again during COVID lockdowns and some new verses came to mind. After he finished writing it he uploaded an iPhone recording to Dropbox where we both share new ideas. It was only up on Dropbox for about 5 minutes and then he decided to delete it. Luckily I had received a notification that it had been uploaded and listened it in those few minutes and I messaged him straight away to tell him that I loved it. \n\n#hollowcoves #indie #aesthetic",

But have you ever wondered how these microchips are made?  Well, in this video, we're going to take a tour of a microchip fabrication plant or fab and walk you through the dozens of steps used to make a microchip.  Specifically, we focus on how CPUs are made.  CPU, GPU, and Smartphone Microchip manufacturing is a multi-trillion dollar industry, and each factory costs in the tens of billions of dollars.  This is an overview of all the processes used to make a microchip, as well as an overview of a microchip factory.  We're planning more videos on microchip manufacturing, such as a 3D animated factory tour.  \n\nThis is the MOST complicated video we've made by FAR!!  4 different animators have been working on this video non-stop for the past 5 months, for a total of 1300 hours of research, modeling, script writing, animating, editing, animating again, rendering, and then more editing.
